    <h5 class="mb-1">How a low-cost ventilator was created, FDA-approved, and made its way to New York hospitals in 30 days</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scott Cohen had chills, headaches, feelings of fatigue, and a fever, all the usual hallmarks of a mild case of COVID-19. Like many New York residents, he hadn't been diagnosed, but he and his wife had most of the symptoms.
The CDC's public advice was to stay hydrated and rest, but Cohen couldn't. It was mid-March and he was working on the Spiro Wave, a device which he hoped would help the city as it scrambled in the face of a significant ventilator shortage — a situation doctors in Italy had been warning about for weeks.
A typical ventilator costs around $30,000, consists of about a million lines of code, requires a lengthy training to use and is often complicated to produce. There are over 22 different technical standards a ventilator must be independently tested for before it can be used. According to an April Johns Hopkins report, the US only had  173,000 ventilators, while some experts were predicting that at least 2.4 million Americans would soon need ventilators.
Companies like Ford Motor announced they'd be producing as many as 50,000 ventilators for hospitals. Production began the week of April 20, but it would be months before those ventilators made their way to hospitals.
Meanwhile, Cohen's $3,300 Spiro Wave ventilator, which was designed, manufactured, and received FDA "emergency use" approval within 30 days, is designed for immediate use. 
The Spiro Wave works as a bridge ventilator, not for the most severely ill patients, but for more stable patients who need help breathing but aren't at such a critical stage.
The device has robotic hands which compress an "ambu bag" — a respiratory bag found in many hospitals — regulating the volume of air and oxygen being pushed into a patient. What a typical care provider might have to do by hand for patients that need help breathing but may not require a ventilator yet, the Spiro Wave will do automatically.
This ensures traditional ventilators, which can also regulate oxygen and air, only get used on the most critically ill patients and makes the work of care providers a little easier.
"The Spiro Wave is not meant to replace ventilators completely, but it expands the functionality of a manual resuscitator bag," Albert Kwon, anesthesiologist at Westchester Medical Center, and member of the Spiro Wave effort, said in a Spiro Wave press conference.
"It helps free up human resources, increases quality control from where a human may be manually bagging a patient, and it helps hospital reallocate conventional ventilators for patients with more sophisticated life support needs."
The Spiro Wave was born when Cohen, the founder of New Lab, a members-only innovation lab based in a formerly abandoned Brooklyn Navy Yard building, received an email in March from Manuel Toscano, an Italian friend and New Lab member.
"He asked me if  there's anything New Lab could do to help design and build ventilators quickly," Cohen told Business Insider. "My reaction was that I'm not sure we could actually do anything that would impact things in the near term."
After Toscano emailed him, Cohen had to Google exactly what a ventilator was and how to make one. His prior experience was in managing the over 80 tech businesses that rented space in New Lab, which served as a hub for new start-ups. He had no experience in medical technology, and neither did most of New Lab's member companies, like Honeybee Robotics, which made devices for NASA, and 3D-printing company Ultimaker.
After his phone call with Toscano, as bodegas and offices across the city began to close down, Cohen began to think about closing New Lab. But then he changed course. 
"I thought, well, we do have all these engineers and mechatronic experts and sensor technology experts and we should be able to do something," he said.
He poked around online for cheap ventilator substitutes and found a prototype for a bridge ventilator created in 2010 in the MIT classroom of a mechanical engineer called Alex Slocum. It had been designed as a prototype for a low-cost ventilator to bring to developing countries, and the idea had sat dormant for a decade. 
Alex Slocum quickly came on board, along with a few other big names in engineering.
They pitched it to New York government, and got an initial investment of $100,000 as a research grant at the end of April. Bill de Blasio announced in an April 21 news briefing that the city had signed a contract to pay almost 10 million dollars for 3,000 Spiro Wave ventilators.
There was a 30-hour sprint to make the first iteration of the Spiro Wave. For engineers, designers, and manufacturers, it felt like time was of the essence.
"It was like a fever pitch of talking to people," said Cohen, who worked from his SoHo living room to mobilize experts from around the world, while his wife sat next to him, taking notes on the phone calls.
The first version was driven straight up to MIT for their engineers to inspect, but it didn't make the grade. The garbage outside the offices piled up with versions of the Spiro Wave, each scrapped as the team refined their ideas.
Ten days into the project, some city officials brought in 20 critical care doctors to look at the device. "They said, 'Yes, we need this and we want it now and how soon can you get it for us?'" said Cohen.
"We were saying, we could deliver it to you if it's like an absolute critical emergency but we'd prefer not to because we still want to improve the software and add alarms and stuff," said Cohen. 
The team of 100 engineers, clinical doctors, and other medical experts Cohen had assembled, took turns sleeping under desks in shifts as they rushed to get the machine ready.
After one nearly-sleepless month, the Spiro Wave received the emergency use FDA approval that would normally take at least a year to get. 
The Spiro Wave is one of a few low-cost ventilators in the process of being pushed to market in record time.
Medtronic has released the blueprint for its ventilator, freely available for other manufacturers to use. Tesla announced it would be re-opening its New York factory to produce Medtronic ventilators, and one Minnesota hospital said the device meant hospital staff would have 450 fewer in-room visits.
The Coventor ventilator, created by a team of University of Minnesota researchers, will cost about $1,000 to produce. The researchers are working with UnitedHealth group to figure where to deploy the ventilators. 
But New York is no longer as in need of these ventilators as they were. "The curve flattened just early enough for us to not have to make those agonizing decisions," Shereef Elnahal, the CEO of University Hospital in Newark, told USA Today.
But many experts have noted that there may be a need again soon, and the US government has invested $2.9 billion in producing 187,000 ventilators. "There is likely to be a second and third wave of coronavirus, and those waves could occur simultaneously with influenza," said Mitchell Katz, CEO of NYC Health and Hospitals, in a press conference. "We may well be using these Spiro Wave devices in our emergency rooms in the future."
Currently, Cohen is in talks with the health ministries of Malaysia, Ethiopia, Colombia,  and South Africa.
The other day, Cohen heard from Toscano, his Italian friend whose email inspired the project. "He's really, really proud of the fact that we all rallied," he said. "He got me thinking about it ... it seems impossible. And then here we are."

The team of 100 engineers, clinical doctors, and other medical experts Cohen had assembled, took turns sleeping under desks in shifts as they rushed to get the machine ready.
After one nearly-sleepless month, the Spiro Wave received the emergency use FDA approval that would normally take at least a year to get.
The Spiro Wave is one of a few low-cost ventilators in the process of being pushed to market in record time.
Medtronic has released the blueprint for its ventilator, freely available for other manufacturers to use. Tesla announced it would be re-opening its New York factory to produce Medtronic ventilators, and one Minnesota hospital said the device meant hospital staff would have 450 fewer in-room visits.
The Coventor ventilator, created by a team of University of Minnesota researchers, will cost about $1,000 to produce. The researchers are working with UnitedHealth group to figure where to deploy the ventilators.
But New York is no longer as in need of these ventilators as they were. “The curve flattened just early enough for us to not have to make those agonizing decisions,” Shereef Elnahal, the CEO of University Hospital in Newark, told USA Today.
But many experts have noted that there may be a need again soon, and the US government has invested $2.9 billion in producing 187,000 ventilators. “There is likely to be a second and third wave of coronavirus, and those waves could occur simultaneously with influenza,” said Mitchell Katz, CEO of NYC Health and Hospitals, in a press conference. “We may well be using these Spiro Wave devices in our emergency rooms in the future.”
Currently, Cohen is in talks with the health ministries of Malaysia, Ethiopia, Colombia, and South Africa.
The other day, Cohen heard from Toscano, his Italian friend whose email inspired the project. “He’s really, really proud of the fact that we all rallied,” he said. “He got me thinking about it … it seems impossible. And then here we are.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Is the coronavirus antibody test a magic bullet — or false hope? </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On March 22, Danny came down with a high fever, chills and body aches “like I never experienced before,” and was sick for five days before finally getting better in early April. The importer of marble and stone from Nassau County was pretty sure he’d had COVID-19, even though he hadn’t been tested for the disease.
Once he recovered, he wanted to be certain he could visit his elderly father and play with his young children without fear of passing on the dreaded infection.
By mid-April, Danny became one of the first New York residents to be tested for coronavirus antibodies at Manhattan Cardiology, one of the few clinics offering the screening at the time. Unlike COVID-19 tests, which require the placing of a swab deep inside a person’s nostrils, his serology test simply drew a vial of blood that was sent to a lab for testing.
“I wanted to see if I had built antibodies to the virus,” said Danny, who lives in Sands Point and did not want to be identified by his last name. “I wanted to make sure I wasn’t contagious.”
While antibody tests are being hailed by some as an “immunity passport” — the first step out of the coronavirus pandemic — public-health officials warn that a positive test does not necessarily mean total immunity to the virus.
“There’s an assumption — a reasonable assumption — that when you have an antibody that you are protected against reinfection,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, an immunologist and member of the White House coronavirus task force, on an April 20 “Good Morning America” appearance. “That has not been proven for this particular virus.”
But for elected officials eager to return to a sense of normalcy and reopen failing economies after weeks of coronavirus lockdown, antibody testing and tracing of COVID-19 on a massive scale have now become de rigueur. Despite the uncertainty and scientists’ lack of knowledge of the virus, hundreds are lining up for the antibody tests in New York, where nearly 300,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19.
“The entire operation has never been done before,” said New York Gov. Cuomo on April 25, pledging to test as many as 40,000 New Yorkers for both the coronavirus and its antibodies on a daily basis.
The military-style operation in the state, which is the epicenter of the virus in the United States, will be conducted with Johns Hopkins University and with funding from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the federal government, which has already pledged $1.5 billion to the effort, Cuomo said.
As of April 27, of those tested in a random sample of 7,500 people, nearly 15 percent were positive, suggesting that statewide more than two million people may have had the virus and shown no symptoms and might now have antibodies to fight against it, Cuomo said. In New York City, early results showed that nearly 25 percent of those tested may have been infected at some point but showed no symptoms.
While the CDC has confirmed that asymptomatic carriers can transmit the disease, it’s still unclear how many of them are contagious and for exactly how long. It’s also unknown whether those who test positive for COVID-19 antibodies are contagious or not.
What the antibody tests do reveal is “what we already know — that the disease is all over the place,” said Marvin Lerner, a retired Manhattan physician and expert on infectious diseases. “Right now we continue to throw money at it with widespread testing, and we think we know what we’re doing. The truth is we’re just wasting billions of dollars.”
Worldwide, there are more than 3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 212,000 deaths, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University. And in the United States, which is now the world leader with more than 1 million confirmed cases, there is still much confusion about the antibody tests themselves, most of which have not been properly vetted by the Food and Drug Administration.
“Doctors should be aware most serology tests haven’t been reviewed by FDA,” tweeted Scott Gottlieb, a physician and former FDA commissioner, on April 21. “Quality is highly variable, with some or perhaps many giving uncertain results. False-positive rates may be inappropriately high. Patients and doctors shouldn’t rely on unproven tests for clinical decisions.”
The head of the world’s largest biotech company took it one step further when he told an April 22 news conference that most of the antibody tests currently on the market are “a disaster.”
“These tests are not worth anything, have very little use,” said Severin Schwan, the CEO for Roche Holding AG, according to Reuters. “Every kind of amateur could produce an antibody test. The two of us could do it overnight in the garage. That’s not the problem. The question is, does it really work?”
Even in the face of these warnings, the FDA is responding to an urgent demand for testing and is now allowing developers to “self-validate” their own antibody tests, clearly labeling their products to indicate they have gone through the vetting on their own and submitted their findings to the FDA.
“It’s kind of like the honor system: The FDA gives you a guideline and you say you followed the guideline and you give them your data,” said Lerner. “But not everyone in business can be trusted and a lot of guys are out there just to make a buck.”
As of April 27, the FDA said it was still reviewing nearly 150 tests and had authorized only seven.
At Northwell Health, which runs 23 hospitals in New York, including Lenox Hill Hospital, staff plan to conduct 10,000 antibody tests per day once their antibody-testing program for the general public gets underway in early May, according to Christopher Zavala, director of business development for Northwell Health Labs. Northwell Health has already started testing hospital workers, a spokesman for the health-care network told The Post.
“Northwell is putting a plan in place for all frontline workers — health-care workers and first responders,” Zavala told The Post. “But because the virus is so new we don’t have any understanding of what will trigger immunity.”
Meanwhile, an increasing number of private clinics in Manhattan are offering serology tests for those who don’t want to wait for public-sector testing.
Cardiologist Robert Segal has been conducting antibody tests at his Manhattan Cardiology clinics on the Upper East Side and Midtown since April 16 “for anyone who has felt that they had exposure to the coronavirus,” he told The Post. He said he’s already tested more than 200 people and is fielding 400 requests a day for the antibody test.
The test itself costs $95, but the price goes up to $299 with pre-screening and administration, Segal said. He is opening up another clinic in Columbus Circle to handle the overflow, he noted. The tests, which are covered by insurance, are set up through LabFinder.com, a platform he co-founded that prescreens candidates before they show up for the blood draw.
“We are not testing the acutely ill,” Segal said. “We are looking for people who feel they may have been exposed to the virus and give them back the trust and confidence that their immune system has developed some kind of level of attack against the virus.”
Segal’s tests have been self-validated and the manufacturer, Diazyme Laboratories, has been authorized by the FDA to produce and market the tests under emergency protocols in place during the coronavirus pandemic, his spokeswoman told The Post.
Unlike some serology test kits that rely on a “pin-prick” sample of blood and feature almost instant results, Segal’s clinics use a vial of blood that is analyzed by a lab. Results take up to 72 hours and are 95 percent accurate, he claimed. “There is a 5 percent false-positive rate which in my world is not dangerous,” Segal said. “Most lab tests have a 5 percent false-positive rate.”
Segal stressed that the tests are not showing full immunity to COVID-19, but the indication of antibodies in the blood that might possibly guard against re-infection and infecting others.
Segal and others also hope that those with COVID-19 antibodies will be in a position to donate “convalescent plasma” to help those stricken with the coronavirus fight the disease. The United States has already treated 500 people with convalescent plasma, conducting clinical trials at 1,500 hospitals across the country. Clinical trials are also underway at hospitals around the world to determine whether plasma transfusions could improve a patient’s recovery and help them survive.
Jake Deutsch, a physician and founder of Cure Urgent Care in Manhattan, was also among the first to offer the tests. On April 24, his two clinics on the Upper East and West sides of the city conducted 250 tests and he has 600 others registered on his Web site, he said, adding that he has already started offering walk-in testing at both of his facilities.
“We’ve been very proactive about getting testing because when you are sick and vulnerable you want reassurance,” he said. “I’m a physician in the business of helping people. When the pandemic started we very quickly pivoted when we saw people who wanted to know if they were contagious.”
Less than two days after his antibody test on April 17, Danny got the results that said he had the COVID-19 antibodies in his blood. The test, he claimed, shows he has a 97 percent chance of immunity and is not contagious.
But while the results made Danny feel better, experts are continuing to ask some hard questions not just about their validity, but also about the way they’re carried out.
“Are these tests true?” asked Lerner, who has a Ph.D. in biochemistry from McGill University in Montreal. When he worked as a physician, Lerner often sent back results of even the most mundane kind of medical tests because he didn’t trust the way labs were handling his requests.
“Are the tests being carried out in the right way when you have a system that is basically in chaos and when most of the good lab technicians have been furloughed?” he wondered. “Technology is only dependent on your level of knowledge as a doctor.”
No matter what the experts say, Danny said he feels like his antibody test has given him his life back.
“I feel amazing knowing that I have almost a 100 percent chance of not catching it again,” he said. “I am still very cautious and wearing my mask when I go to the supermarket and the bank, but now I can touch things again. It sounds crazy, but it’s a great feeling.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain to trial new coronavirus tracing system</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England, cabinet minister Michael Gove said on Sunday as the government looks at how to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection.
Suffering one of the worst death tolls in Europe from COVID-19, Britain is confident that the peak of the virus has passed and is now looking at how to restart its shuttered economy and ease social restrictions on citizens.
“This week we will be piloting new test, track and trace procedures on the Isle of Wight with a view to having that in place more widely later this month,” Gove told a news conference.
A mass testing system along with the ability to trace people who have been in contact with those who test positive are seen as crucial to preventing a second spike and facilitating the relaxation of a lockdown which has lasted almost six weeks.
Gove said the system being trialled next week would include asking citizens on the island to download a smartphone app as well as traditional ways of tracing those who have come into contact with a patient who has tested positive.
“We will be able to make sure that people who are suffering from the virus ... they and their contacts can be encouraged to stay at home, so that we can limit the potential of any outbreak,” Gove said.
The Isle of Wight has around 80,000 households.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everything we learned from the Downing Street coronavirus briefing today</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new trial to trace the spread of coronavirus in Britain is due to begin on the Isle of Wight next week, the government has confirmed.
Cabinet minister Michael Gove announced the measure at the latest Covid-19 briefing at Downing Street on Sunday afternoon.
He said the Prime Minister Boris Johnson will offer more detail next week on how Britain will begin returning to work as the number of deaths continues to fall.
Mr Gove also addressed a number of other issues such as easing lockdown restrictions, helping the most vulnerable and providing PPE for the NHS.
It comes as a further 15 people have died in Greater Manchester hospitals having contracted coronavirus.
It means the total number of deaths in the county's hospitals now stands at 1,366.
NHS trusts in Greater Manchester today (Sunday) confirmed 15 more people have died in their hospitals, a fall from 25 in the previous 24-hour period.
This reflects a general downward trend with a fall in the number of deaths recorded in each of the last four days.
However, experts and politicians say figures must be treated with caution as there are fewer NHS staff working at weekends and so fewer deaths tend to be recorded.
Here's what Mr Gove had to say about the government's response to the crisis:
Britain will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, as the government looks at how to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection.
"This week we will be piloting new test, track and trace procedures on the Isle of Wight with a view to having that in place more widely later this month," Mr Gove told a news conference.
Mr Gove said that 90% of rough sleepers known to councils have been given an offer of accommodation since the end of March,
Providing an update on work that was being done to help vulnerable people, he said the Government was nearing delivering its one millionth parcel of essential food.
In terms of NHS volunteers, he told the briefing that more than 600,000 people have been verified "and are helping with the daily errands that make such a significant difference".
He also said officials were "working with supermarkets to make sure that a greater number of delivery slots are made available to those most in need".
Mr Gove detailed the Government's current and proposed provisions for disadvantaged children.
He said the Government has committed £100 million for remote learning for "those who need it most" and 180 video lessons per week were being supplied through the newly launched Oak National Academy.
"We're particularly keen to help vulnerable and disadvantaged children to carry on with their education during the pandemic," he said.
Mr Gove said the Government has ordered laptops for disadvantaged children sitting exams next year and for children with social workers to help them stay in touch with vital services.
The coronavirus outbreak has left many people across Greater Manchester struggling for access to food, basics and other support. Many of them are self-isolating, often in fragile health and alone.
Public services have been working hard to find and help them, but we know they are over-stretched and working round the clock.
So the Manchester Evening News and the Greater Manchester Mayor's Charity have launched Covaid-19 - a fundraiser aimed at supporting those who most need help, from elderly people with no support network to homeless families living in hotels.
The money will be distributed via the mayor of Greater Manchester's charity.

He added free internet routers and free school meal vouchers are being provided for those who need them.
According to Mr Gove, more than 49,000 children were classed by schools as vulnerable on April 24, "more than double" the figure from a week earlier.
He said 15,500 schools have placed orders for free school meal vouchers, and more than £35 million worth have been redeemed.
Talking about PPE, Mr Gove said: "On personal protective equipment for key workers, we are increasing the spread of distribution and supply.
"From February 25 to May 2 we had delivered over 1.08 billion items of PPE across the health and social care system within England.
"And tens of millions more have been distributed by our colleagues in the devolved administrations.
"This overall figure includes 149 million masks, 173 million aprons, two million gowns and 614 million gloves.
"On May 2 alone we delivered an additional 20 million items of PPE within England."
He said there is "much more to do".
Mr Gove said: "We've all learned to adapt, and we must carry on doing so after the Prime Minister sets out how we will get back to work later this week.
"His comprehensive plan will explain how we can get our economy moving, how we can get our children back to school, how we can travel to work more safely, and how we can make life in the workplace safer.
"But before we can ease the existing restrictions we must ensure the government's five tests are met - that the number of cases are falling, that death rates are declining, that the NHS has what it needs, and that measures are in place to stop a second peak overwhelming the NHS."
He said he is "particularly conscious" that those in the frontline of our public services will need "clear guidance on safe working".
He added: "They'll need the right personal protective equipment and appropriate access to testing if we are to make all the progress that we want in the weeks ahead.
"We're consulting with employers and unions, professionals and public health experts, to establish how we can ensure that we have the safest possible working environments, and the Prime Minister will be saying more later this week."
Mr Gove said more than 200,000 key workers and their families had been tested for coronavirus.
He said criteria for testing had been extended beyond key workers to anyone over 65 displaying symptoms and anyone who has to travel to get to work.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stormont executive to discuss phased pathway out of lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE Stormont executive is set to discuss a pathway out of lockdown, as a further 16 deaths were confirmed in the north over the weekend.
The Department of Health recorded 11 Covid-19 -related deaths on Saturday and a further five today, bringing the total to 381.
The figures are one of two sets currently being produced.
Statistics agency Nisra said on Friday there had been 393 deaths up to April 24 according to information on death certificates.
Sinn Féin communities minister Deirdre Hargey said that the executive would adopt a "phased approach" to easing lockdown restrictions.
She said ministers are to meet on Monday, Wednesday and likely Thursday as part of intensive work evaluating the battle against coronavirus.
Details will be published within the next two weeks.
"As we start to ease those restrictions it's important that we don't do that too quick in that you reverse the good work that has been done up until now," she told the BBC.
"We have to gradually introduce those slowly, adhering to the medical advice and looking at the modelling as we start to move through an easement process and indeed that has to be planned and managed."
She said the lockdown will not be completely lifted and there will still be a "level of social distancing" to guard against a potential second wave of the virus.
British Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said Prime Minister Boris Johnson will also set out a plan for easing lockdown restrictions on Thursday.
He said some social distancing measures will remain in place until a vaccine has been developed but ministers will seek to restore people's lives to "as close to normal as possible".
The UK Covid-19 death toll now stands at 28,446 after 315 fatalities were added to the total yesterday.
It also emerged that testing up to 9am on Sunday had fallen to 76,496 - a drop from 122,000 tests carried out on April 30.
Transport secretary Grant Shapps admitted that fewer people would have died if more tests had been available earlier.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar revealed a five-stage plan to exit lockdown in the Republic last Friday.
A further 19 people with Covid 19 died in the south yesterday, bringing the death toll to 1,303.
Officials also said that 950 people are being treated in hospitals with either confirmed or suspected cases of the virus.
Of those, 98 confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases are being treated in intensive care.
HSE chief operations officer Anne O'Connor said the health service has not seen the kind of numbers it had originally feared.
It has also emerged that it has a plan for private hospitals to carry out urgent procedures that are not coronavirus-related that may have been delayed due to the outbreak.
"Our original intention for the use of the private hospitals was as part of our surge capacity and to give us extra capacity to meet the demand over Covid-19," HSE chief executive Paul Reid said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aarogya app: Why it raises privacy worries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The “National Directives for Covid-19 Management” issued by the Union home ministry on Friday have made the use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app “mandatory for all employees, both private and public” and people living in the containment zones for two weeks from Monday onwards.
Punishment ranging from six months’ to two years’ imprisonment has been prescribed for those among the targeted population who fail to download the app.
A primer on the app and the concerns its being made mandatory has raised:
What is Aarogya Setu?
Aarogya Setu, developed by the National Informatics Centre and launched on April 2, is an improvised version of the Corona Kavach app developed in March by the Union ministries of electronics and information technology, and health and family welfare.
Available in 12 languages, Aarogya Setu uses Bluetooth and a mobile phone’s global positioning system to let users and governments know a person has come in contact with a coronavirus patient.
How does it work?
On registration, a user enters personal details including their name, age, gender, phone number, profession and countries visited in the last 30 days. The app rates the risk perception according to the answers one gives on a self-assessment form about one’s health and exposure to potential coronavirus patients.
When a coronavirus patient who has truthfully filled in the self-assessment form comes within 10 metres of any other user, both get a notification warning them.
Has something like this worked elsewhere?
At least 27 countries have such apps, and at least 10 of them have government sanction. Officials say the low mortality rate in Singapore and South Korea is partially attributed to the success of their contact-tracing apps.
That China has so far been able to avert a second wave of the infection may be related to its use of a similar app.
Even before the home ministry’s order, Prasar Bharati, the Central Armed Police Forces, Zomato and Urban Company had directed their employees and contractual staff to download the app. Government employees have been asked to step out for work only if the app shows them as “low risk”.
What are the problems?
The app requires a user to keep their Bluetooth and GPS on.
Two users on different floors of the same building can be shown as contacts, according to news website Medianama.
Once you register, you cannot deregister. Uninstalling the app does not deregister your account.
Permissions the app requires include preventing the phone from going into sleep mode to conserve battery.
The app’s success depends on the honesty with which the user fills in the self-assessment form.
News agency ANI has reported that the army has cautioned its personnel against downloading an app with a similar sounding name as it is suspected to be a malicious app linked to Pakistan’s espionage services.
What are the privacy concerns?
In a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, 45 civil society groups said: “In the absence of a legislative guarantee containing a sunset clause, sensitive personal data about health and movement of gig (casual) workers collected by the Aarogya Setu app could be misused for profiling and mass surveillance even after the Covid-19 outbreak is over.”
They added that the app deviated from international best practices on several counts. These include:
⚫ Its being made mandatory;
⚫ Collection of too much personal data;
⚫ A lack of information on how the data would be kept anonymous;
⚫ The lack of liability on the government for misidentifying a patient, which can lead to loss of income and mobility;
⚫ The possibility of use for non-Covid health research;
⚫ The possibility of use by law-enforcement agencies.
The push to make the app mandatory for a section of the people apparently stems from the requirement that at least half the population use the app to make it effective.
In 2017, India had an estimated 46.2 crore smart phones. The country’s population is currently estimated to be almost 138 crore. Of these 8.3 crore had downloaded the app till Saturday.
A feature phone variant may be released soon, which will expand the pool of potential users to 50 crore.
The Internet Freedom Foundation said: “The order further indicates criminal penalties for non-compliance in Paragraph No. 16 that states, ‘Any person violating these lockdown measures and the National Directives for Covid-19 Management will be liable to be proceeded against as per the provision of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of the IPC and other legal provisions as applicable’. The specific provision that may be attracted for prosecution under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, is Section 51(b) that provides for a maximum punishment of up to 1 year for disobedience, and 2 years when such actions may lead to a loss of life. The penalty for conviction under Section 188 of the IPC extends to 6 months’ imprisonment.”
Rahul Gandhi had tweeted: “The Arogya Setu app is a sophisticated surveillance system, outsourced to a private operator, with no institutional oversight — raising serious data security & privacy concerns. Technology can help keep us safe; but fear must not be leveraged to track citizens without their consent.”
BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad, who is also Union minister for communications, electronics and information technology, denied that the app had been outsourced to a private operator. He asserted that it has a “robust data security architecture”.
Are the rest of the data in the phone safe?
Nikhil Pahwa, one of India’s pioneers in digital rights and founder of MediaNama, a digital and telecom policy news website, said: “Theoretically, the data we generate using our phones, such as location data, or our SMS history, call history, apart from who we have been close to, are at risk depending on what kind of data the government chooses to collect from our phones as the scope of Aarogya Setu expands.
“The government has already said that it wants to expand the scope to include e-pass and telemedicine. How it deals with contact-tracing data is limited well enough by its privacy policy, but how it deals with other data is not clear. Privacy policies can change.
“Another problem is that if there is a data leak or a misuse of data, users at present can’t hold anyone liable, because a data controller or data fiduciary has not been defined.”
Asked about Prasad’s denial of Rahul’s allegations about the app, Pahwa replied: “The minister ignores the fact that there is no institutional oversight: Aarogya Setu is not backed by law, and there is no institution managing the data. Aarogya Setu is a surveillance app, and it collects highly personal data: your location data and who you have been in close proximity with.”
On the safety of the data on a phone that installs the app, Alagunambi Welkin, a free software movement activist and general secretary of the Chennai-based Union of IT and IT-enabled Services Employees, said: “I worry more about the curated data stored in a centralised server. We are living in the age of data, where the value of corporates who have access to a large sum of data weighs more than the oil conglomerates. We have also seen how elections in both our own country and others like the US have made use of citizens’ data to push their political agenda.
“When millions of citizens’ data are stored in a centralised infrastructure and all a citizen can do is just blindly ‘trust’ it won’t be misused, (it could be) proved false. When (WikiLeaks founder) Julian Assange, (American whistleblower Edward) Snowden and WikiLeaks exposed such violations, we should not be making the same mistake of trusting the authority when the benefits of violating it in favour of the authority is high.”
Welkin added: “Ideally, the government should adhere to its open source policy and have the mobile application source code (made) accessible to the public. India is the world’s IT hub, we have 41 million employees capable of verifying it.
“All curated data should be accessed only via a blockchain-enabled system where every access to data is recorded with enough meta data (about) which authority (is) accessing it, for what, on whose approval, for how long, etc — and that should be made transparently available to the public in real time. These aspects can be a starting point for creating trust in authorities where profit and benefit for (those in) power overrides trust and benefits for the people.”
On Prasad’s tweets, he said: “In the name of innovation and Digital India and the $3-trillion digital opportunity vision of the ministry of electronics and information technology, state e-governance and IT departments created various applications which were prepared by private companies. Most of them lack privacy first design, and the authorities do not worry much about ensuring privacy.... Like any government, the Congress as well initiated surveillance programmes like the Central Monitoring System, DRDO Netra, etc.
“Fast-forwarding a data protection act, as strong as the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union and high on the fine amount for violators, can save us from future cyber security disasters.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">India orders coronavirus tracing app for all public and private sector employees</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) — India has ordered all public and private sector employees to use a government-backed contact tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as it begins easing some of its lockdown measures in districts less affected by the coronavirus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government said on Friday that India, with the world’s second-largest population after China, would extend nationwide curbs for another two weeks from Monday but allow “considerable relaxations” in lower-risk areas.
India last month launched the Aarogya Setu (Health Bridge) app, a Bluetooth and GPS-based system that alerts users who may have come in contact with people who later test positive for COVID-19. “Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public,” the Ministry of Home Affairs said late on Friday. Company heads will be held responsible “to ensure 100% coverage” among employees. Officials at the technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needed to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in a population of 1.3 billion.
The app has been downloaded around 83 million times in total in a country with a smartphone user base of about 500 million, according to the technology ministry. The app’s compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app. “Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body,” said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet browser company Mozilla.
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy, as all data is collected anonymously. The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding information would be used “only for administering necessary medical interventions.” Critics also note that about 400 million of India’s population do not possess smartphones and would not be covered.
The government on Friday said that reopening offices would also have to ensure gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain the spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths. India has reported more than 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths. India is set to allow some factories to reopen, and companies are scrambling to piece together their plans.
Smartphone maker Lava is likely to open its plants in Noida, on the outskirts of New Delhi, next week, said cofounder S.N. Rai. Lava is asking its workers to temporarily move to a neighboring village, where it has leased dormitories for about 800 workers and is proving food and transport, said Rai. “But even if we start production immediately, we will start with a maximum of 40% capacity,” said Rai.
Other sectors such as the automobile industry are calling on the government to allow them to reopen. The automotive sector is losing revenue of 23 billion rupees ($304 million) a day, three lobby groups said in a letter to the home ministry, urging the government to allow component makers and dealers to begin operations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: India makes government tracing app mandatory for all workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on Friday (May 1) said India - the country with the largest number of people in lockdown - would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 illness, but allow "considerable relaxations" in lower-risk districts.
As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu - meaning Health Bridge - a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country's National Informatics Centre. 
The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for COVID-19 or deemed to be at high risk.
"Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public," India's Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late on Friday.
It will be the responsibility of the heads of companies and organisations "to ensure 100 per cent coverage of this app among the employees", the ministry said.
Officials at India's technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people.
The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India's smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data.
The app's compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app.
"Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body," said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla.
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.
The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used "only for administering necessary medical interventions".
On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.
India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India makes the use of coronavirus contact tracing app compulsory for all workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The BJP government in India announced on Friday that countrywide lockdowns would be extended for another two weeks to curb the spread of the coronavirus. However, regions that are deemed at lower-risk would be permitted "considerable relaxations." According to Reuters, the Indian government has instructed all public and private sector employees to use Aarogya Setu, the government-backed contact tracing app, in addition to maintaining social distance as lockdowns are eased in less affected areas. The Ministry of Home Affairs said:
The app, which launched last month, uses the phone's Bluetooth range as proximity sensor, alerting users who may have come in contact with people who later test positive for COVID-19. Since launch, the app has been downloaded around 83 million times, the technology ministry said. India, which has the world's second-largest population in the world behind China, has more than 500 million smartphone users.
As per the announcement, those heading companies are to ensure "100% coverage" among workers. Officials believe that for the app to be effective in the country, it needs to be downloaded on at least 200 million phones. There have been security and privacy concerns raised, but the government said that all data collection is anonymous.
As per statistics by Johns Hopkins University, there have been 37,776 cases and 1,223 deaths in India due to the coronavirus.

The One Touch has dropped to $140 at a few retailers like Best Buy, but Newegg is the only one offering an extra $10 off. That makes it the best place to go for this portable SSD today.
Portable SSDs are usually priced at a premium just because they offer a significant upgrade over portable hard drives in terms of durability and speed, but if you don't want to pay that price and still need some portable storage, we've got you covered. Newegg also has the Seagate Expansion 2TB portable hard drive on sale for $55.99. That's more space and a much more affordable price.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Seagate's One Touch 1TB portable SSD has dropped to a new low of $130</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Seagate One Touch STJE1000402 1TB portable solid state drive is down to $129.99 at Newegg with code 93XPJ39. That's a great low price because the 1TB One Touch normally sells for around $160 or more. You can find it going for $165 at Staples right now. The One Touch has dropped to $140 at a few retailers like Best Buy, but Newegg is the only one offering an extra $10 off. That makes it the best place to go for this portable SSD today.
Portable SSDs are usually priced at a premium just because they offer a significant upgrade over portable hard drives in terms of durability and speed, but if you don't want to pay that price and still need some portable storage, we've got you covered. Newegg also has the Seagate Expansion 2TB portable hard drive on sale for $55.99. That's more space and a much more affordable price.

In a perfect world, portable solid state drives would be just as inexpensive as portable hard drives.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dutch McDonald's trials social-distancing restaurant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(This May 1, story is refiled to amend headline)
By Bart H. Meijer
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Big Macs delivered on meal trolleys, hand sanitizers at the entrance and designated waiting spots to separate customers could become a feature of McDonald’s restaurants in the Netherlands when they are allowed to reopen.
In a trial at a restaurant in the city of Arnhem, McDonald’s has been looking for ways to maintain social distancing when the coronavirus lockdown is relaxed.
“We have tried to figure out how to keep our customers and employees safe, while maintaining a restaurant atmosphere,” McDonald’s Netherlands spokeswoman Eunice Koekkoek told Reuters.
“These are drastic changes, but we hope to make them in a way that customers don’t notice them too much.”
Restaurants, bars and other public places in the Netherlands have been closed since March 15. As of Friday, 39,791 coronavirus cases had been confirmed with 4,893 deaths.
But new infections have been dropping, prompting calls to loosen the lockdown after its current deadline of May 19.
A decision on whether to reopen restaurants and bars is expected around May 12, but Prime Minister Mark Rutte has ruled out a return to normal.
If they do reopen, they will have to keep customers and staff at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart to avoid a new wave of infections.
McDonald’s says it could introduce table service, with burgers and fries wheeled to customers on trolleys from which they can pick up their orders.
Other new features would include hand-washing stations at the entrance and a host behind a plastic screen showing customers their place in line.
Many restaurant owners in the Netherlands fear social distancing will simply put them out of business.
But McDonald’s expects its new set-up will work at 180 larger restaurants out of its 252 franchises in the country.
“On average this will allow us to serve around 66% of our normal number of customers,” Koekkoek said.
“We don’t expect reopening to be allowed before June. But even then, we will move in steps. Readjusting 180 restaurants is a tall order.”
About three quarters of McDonald’s 39,000 restaurants worldwide were operational as of Thursday, including almost all its nearly 14,000 outlets in the United States, where drive-throughs are common. [nL4N2CI457]

McDonald's Netherlands recently tested new features at a location in the Dutch city of Arnhem, including meal trolleys and designated waiting spots to separate customers. 
"These are drastic changes, but we hope to make them in a way that customers don't notice them too much," McDonald's Netherlands spokeswoman Eunice Koekkoek told Reuters.
In the US, a representative told Business Insider that the chain is moving "thoughtfully and judiciously to make changes to our operations in collaboration with our franchisees." McDonald's has already changed nearly 50 processes, the representative said, including wellness checks, installing protective barriers, social distancing floor decals, and providing thermometers to restaurants.

    <h5 class="mb-1">There's a new competitor in the world of eerily lifelike four-legged robots — take a closer look at Unitree's robot dogs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The world of four-legged robotic dogs just got a little bigger.
Chinese robotics company Unitree debuted its newest robot, the A1, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier in 2020. Now, Unitree is using social media to show off the tricks the new robots can do.
The robot is small, about one foot wide and two feet long, and it can move shockingly quickly. Unitree says the robot's walking speed is about ten feet per second or seven miles per hour. Walking isn't the only thing they can do, either — videos show them performing all kinds of jumps and flips, thanks to flexible joints and a strong motor. Each foot even has sensors that take in information to send to the motor to make movements more efficient.
The A1 weighs about 26 pounds, including its battery, and has a battery life of up to two hours. It can also carry up to 11 pounds, with potential as a delivery robot. A smart camera enables real-time video transmission, with many potential private and public uses for the robot.
The A1 is already being compared to Boston Dynamic's Spot robot, arguably the most well-known four-legged robot, with designs that mirror lifelike movements that resemble people and animals leading to an uncanny valley effect that may make viewers uncomfortable.
Spot has elicited both positive and negative responses for its uses, like screening patients for coronavirus in a Boston hospital or working with the Massachusetts State Police.
For now, Unitree seems to be looking towards private ownership, tweeting that the robot could be a "future pet" and that they are "running with you to the future." The company also emphasizes that it will cost less than $10,000, though it does not name a specific price.
Here's what the A1 looks like.

The A1 is already being compared to Boston Dynamic’s Spot robot, arguably the most well-known four-legged robot, with designs that mirror lifelike movements that resemble people and animals leading to an uncanny valley effect that may make viewers uncomfortable.
Spot has elicited both positive and negative responses for its uses, like screening patients for coronavirus in a Boston hospital or working with the Massachusetts State Police.
For now, Unitree seems to be looking towards private ownership, tweeting that the robot could be a “future pet” and that they are “running with you to the future.” The company also emphasises that it will cost less than $US10,000, though it does not name a specific price.
Here’s what the A1 looks like.

    <h5 class="mb-1">There’s a new competitor in the world of eerily lifelike four-legged robots — take a closer look at Unitree’s robot dogs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The world of four-legged robotic dogs just got a little bigger.
Chinese robotics company Unitree debuted its newest robot, the A1, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier in 2020. Now, Unitree is using social media to show off the tricks the new robots can do.
The robot is small, about one foot wide and two feet long, and it can move shockingly quickly. Unitree says the robot’s walking speed is about ten feet per second or seven miles per hour. Walking isn’t the only thing they can do, either – videos show them performing all kinds of jumps and flips, thanks to flexible joints and a strong motor. Each foot even has sensors that take in information to send to the motor to make movements more efficient.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meet the 33 people with the most power at YouTube, the world's biggest online video company</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006, and it's turned into the world's biggest and most powerful online video company and an advertising juggernaut.
With original programming and user-generated content that reaches more than two billion people each month, YouTube rivals streaming giants including Netflix and Amazon.
It pulled in $15 billion in advertising revenue in 2019, more than TV networks ABC, NBC, and Fox combined. Another $3 billion came from non-ad revenue in products like YouTube Music and YouTube TV, though YouTube pays a portion of that money back to networks and publishers in distribution rights. And YouTube is making a bigger push into TV and streaming as more people shift from watching linear TV.
Business Insider identified the 33 executives there with the most power, from policy, engineering, content, and advertising, these insiders are leading all of YouTube's businesses.
The platform has turned content creators, from MrBeast to Emma Chamberlain, into stars with multi-platform businesses and major brand partnerships. With the help of partner managers, top YouTube creators are establishing new business models for Hollywood.
YouTube has also drawn regulators' antitrust and privacy questions. In September, YouTube got hit with a $170 million fee for reportedly violating the Child Online Privacy Protection Act. The company has struggled to keep out extremist content and ads that break its rules against misinformation.
Business Insider identified the top people behind YouTube's growing ad business. They include Kevin Allocca, who leads the global culture and trends team focused on analyzing and tracking trending content at YouTube. It also includes leaders like Neal Mohan, who reports directly to CEO Susan Wojcicki and oversees all of the products on the viewer and creator side.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The midsize pickup-truck segment had for some time been left to the popular Toyota Tacoma and the ancient Nissan Frontier. But about five years ago, automakers decided to liven it up. Chevy brought back its Colorado pickup (as well as a GMC version, the Canyon). Then Honda revamped its Ridgeline, and Ford reintroduced the Ranger.
Jeep has done a small pickup in the past, so when it announced that it would restore the Gladiator nameplate to an all-new truck, there was much rejoicing.
The pickup arrived last year, and I recently tested it. The upshot was that it gives the off-road-focused Chevy Colorado Bison ZR1 a run for its money.
The Gladiator Rubicon, with its stout 4x4 setup and premium extras, is perhaps the full-featured midsize pickup money can buy.
Here's why:
UConnect is an industry underdog, but we've found it matches up well against the competition. It does everything well, from GPS navigation to Bluetooth and USB device connectivity.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The midsize pickup-truck segment had for some time been left to the popular Toyota Tacoma and the ancient Nissan Frontier. But about five years ago, automakers decided to liven it up. Chevy brought back its Colorado pickup (as well as a GMC version, the Canyon). Then Honda revamped its Ridgeline, and Ford reintroduced the Ranger.
Jeep has done a small pickup in the past, so when it announced that it would restore the Gladiator nameplate to an all-new truck, there was much rejoicing.
The pickup arrived last year, and I recently tested it. The upshot was that it gives the off-road-focused Chevy Colorado Bison ZR1 a run for its money.
The Gladiator Rubicon, with its stout 4×4 setup and premium extras, is perhaps the full-featured midsize pickup money can buy.
Here’s why:
UConnect is an industry underdog, but we’ve found it matches up well against the competition. It does everything well, from GPS navigation to Bluetooth and USB device connectivity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Adidas is using AI and 3D printing to cope with a plunge in sales during the coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">German sportswear giant Adidas plans to bolster its lagging performance by shifting strategy to focus on its digital platform.The fitness brand reported a 19% sales decline this week as more than 70% of its global stores remained closed during the coronavirus pandemic.
Over an earnings call with company executives, Adidas zeroed in on plans for "digital acceleration" and said it would pivot to a greater focus on its digital presence now that it has limited capacity to operate out of physical stores.
Business Insider got some insights from Adidas into what its revamped digital focus involves: 
Adidas also says it is investing in its digital retail infrastructure, and is reaping the benefits during the coronavirus as its online stores, as well of those of partner retailers, are open all the time. Its physical stores and other sporting-goods retailers remain closed in most parts of the world.
The brand's ecommerce sales saw the highest growth rate on record last year, a jump of 34%. That spurt accelerated even further as sales for ecommerce grew by 35% in currency-neutral terms with 55% growth in March this year.The firm aims to support this trend by connecting experts from its retail teams, mobile-fitness app Runtastic, and the IT team, all working towards building up ecommerce. Adidas is also extending partnership programs with digital pure players — companies that only run virtually — such as Zalando, Asos, Zappos, and Tmall.
 
As well as focusing more heavily on ecommerce, Adidas is also promoting heavily products that are selling well while people are stuck at home. The brand is increasingly promoting products like the Adilette Slides — a favorite among consumers working from home — as they have enjoyed high demand on the brand's channels. Adilette sales went up by a 'triple-digit percentage' rate in April, the company said.
For its sports apps "adidas Running" and "adidas Training", the brand has been offering free premium access since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, hundreds of thousands of athletes have used more than 250 training videos, workouts and training plans to continue keeping fit from home.
Adidas has also focused its marketing investments and efforts towards digital and social media channels and an increase in digital storytelling under the hashtag "#hometeam."
Over the past few weeks, the brand has shared inspiring home stories from the daily lives of numerous brand ambassadors around the world who demonstrate creative ways to "make the most of time at home and, of course, to continue to exercise."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Decontaminating a surface with the coronavirus is a 2-step process. A biohazard cleaner says people are skipping the first step., Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The novel coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through respiratory droplets released when you sneeze or cough, but it can also linger on surfaces in your home.
To reduce your chance of infection, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cleaning areas you touch often, like doorknobs, sinks, and toilets.
But cleaning a surface isn’t the same as disinfecting it.
The cleaning process involves scrubbing an area with soap and water, while disinfecting means applying a chemical to kill germs.
“The most important step is the cleaning step,” Cory Chalmers, the CEO of the professional cleaning service Steri-Clean, told Business Insider.
His team specializes in biohazard cleaning for sites contaminated with infectious diseases. For the past month, the team has dedicated itself almost exclusively to scrubbing down places contaminated by the new coronavirus. That includes homes, cruise ships, offices, factories, and fast-food restaurants.
“A lot of people spray a surface and then wipe it around right away,” Chalmers said. “But you’re not letting the disinfectant do its job.”
That’s because dirty surfaces are coated in clusters of germs called biofilm that resist disinfectants. These germs have to be removed before a chemical can effectively kill off any lingering viruses or bacteria.
Chalmers said the first step in the cleaning process should be putting soap on a rag or paper towel and then folding the towel into quarters. The towel will lift the biofilm off the surface so only residual germs are left behind.
After you’ve wiped down a small surface – a couple of square feet – flip the towel over and use the other side, then turn it inside out and use the remaining quarters.
“People sometimes will walk around the house with the same rag, cleaning all the surfaces. That doesn’t do anything because now they’re just spreading the germs around,” Chalmers said. “Once that towel or rag that you’re using is full of germs, it’s not going to absorb anymore.”
After the surface is clean, you can apply a disinfectant spray or wipe.
Chalmers said the back of every disinfectant bottle was marked with a “dwell time” – how long the disinfectant needs to sit on a surface before it kills germs. Some disinfectants take 10 minutes, while others only about 30 seconds.
Depending on the type of surface, it’s possible to let the coronavirus die on its own. Research from the University of Hong Kong suggests that the novel coronavirus can live for three hours on printing and tissue paper but for two days on cloth.
The virus tends to survive for much longer on glass and paper money: about four days.
But its lifespan also depends on temperature and humidity. The Hong Kong researchers found that the coronavirus lasted up to two weeks in a test tube under 39 degrees Fahrenheit, but just one day under 99 degrees Fahrenheit. A group of Beijing researchers also determined that high temperature and high humidity could reduce the virus’ transmission.
Since there’s still more research to be done, Chalmers said cleaning and disinfecting was a safer method than waiting for the virus to die.
“When you’re dealing with a new strain like this, we really don’t have all the answers,” he said. “I don’t think we have enough factual data to know that closing up a building or an office or a room will kill that virus.”
That’s also why he recommends being extra cautious when wiping things down – or hiring a service to do it for you.
“There are so many companies out there from landscapers to plumbers to exterminators that are all claiming they’re experts and they’re going to disinfect your house,” Chalmers said.
“Ask them how they’re doing it. What’s the process? Are they cleaning first, then applying the disinfectant? Are they testing? If they’re doing all three of those, you should be safe.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Decontaminating a surface with the coronavirus is a 2-step process. A biohazard cleaner says people are skipping the first step.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The novel coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through respiratory droplets released when you sneeze or cough, but it can also linger on surfaces in your home.
To reduce your chance of infection, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cleaning areas you touch often, like doorknobs, sinks, and toilets.
But cleaning a surface isn't the same as disinfecting it.
The cleaning process involves scrubbing an area with soap and water, while disinfecting means applying a chemical to kill germs.
"The most important step is the cleaning step," Cory Chalmers, the CEO of the professional cleaning service Steri-Clean, told Business Insider.
His team specializes in biohazard cleaning for sites contaminated with infectious diseases. For the past month, the team has dedicated itself almost exclusively to scrubbing down places contaminated by the new coronavirus. That includes homes, cruise ships, offices, factories, and fast-food restaurants.
"A lot of people spray a surface and then wipe it around right away," Chalmers said. "But you're not letting the disinfectant do its job."
That's because dirty surfaces are coated in clusters of germs called biofilm that resist disinfectants. These germs have to be removed before a chemical can effectively kill off any lingering viruses or bacteria.
Chalmers said the first step in the cleaning process should be putting soap on a rag or paper towel and then folding the towel into quarters. The towel will lift the biofilm off the surface so only residual germs are left behind.
After you've wiped down a small surface — a couple of square feet — flip the towel over and use the other side, then turn it inside out and use the remaining quarters.
LoadingSomething is loading.
"People sometimes will walk around the house with the same rag, cleaning all the surfaces. That doesn't do anything because now they're just spreading the germs around," Chalmers said. "Once that towel or rag that you're using is full of germs, it's not going to absorb anymore."
After the surface is clean, you can apply a disinfectant spray or wipe.
Chalmers said the back of every disinfectant bottle was marked with a "dwell time" — how long the disinfectant needs to sit on a surface before it kills germs. Some disinfectants take 10 minutes, while others only about 30 seconds.
Depending on the type of surface, it's possible to let the coronavirus die on its own. Research from the University of Hong Kong suggests that the novel coronavirus can live for three hours on printing and tissue paper but for two days on cloth.
The virus tends to survive for much longer on glass and paper money: about four days.
But its lifespan also depends on temperature and humidity. The Hong Kong researchers found that the coronavirus lasted up to two weeks in a test tube under 39 degrees Fahrenheit, but just one day under 99 degrees Fahrenheit. A group of Beijing researchers also determined that high temperature and high humidity could reduce the virus' transmission.
Since there's still more research to be done, Chalmers said cleaning and disinfecting was a safer method than waiting for the virus to die.
"When you're dealing with a new strain like this, we really don't have all the answers," he said. "I don't think we have enough factual data to know that closing up a building or an office or a room will kill that virus."
That's also why he recommends being extra cautious when wiping things down — or hiring a service to do it for you.
"There are so many companies out there from landscapers to plumbers to exterminators that are all claiming they're experts and they're going to disinfect your house," Chalmers said.
"Ask them how they're doing it. What's the process? Are they cleaning first, then applying the disinfectant? Are they testing? If they're doing all three of those, you should be safe."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Global Expedition Vehicles, which specializes in custom overlanding vehicles, created the Pangea RV that can be built on medium-duty trucks from brands like Mercedes-Benz and Freightliner Trucks.
The Pangea has amenities that can be found in any non-mobile home, such as a kitchen, a dining area, a bathroom, and several beds. But unlike traditional homes, the roof of the Pangea can be hydraulically lifted, giving the tiny home a 10-foot interior height and access to the lofted beds.
In total, the tiny home on wheels is 8 feet wide and 17 feet long, although customers can request the length to be extended up to 25 feet. The interior dimensions of the tiny home falls just a bit shorter with a length of 16.3 feet, width of 7.3 feet, and height of 6.3 feet from the floor to the bottom of the lofted bed.
This isn't the only build from Missouri-based Global Expedition Vehicles: the company has at least nine other builds — not including custom designs — including the UXV-MAX which, along with the Pangea, starts at $650,000.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> 
US electric carmaker Tesla Inc has applied for a licence to supply electricity in the United Kingdom, The Telegraph reported on Saturday.
The purpose of the licence from the energy regulator may be to introduce the company’s Autobidder platform, the report said, citing a company source. The application did not make clear why Tesla has applied for the licence, The Telegraph reported.
Autobidder is a platform for automated energy trading and is currently being operated at Tesla’s Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia.
Having built a significant battery business in recent years, the carmaker is now preparing to enter the British market with its technology, the paper said, citing industry sources.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
In 2017, the carmaker built world’s largest lithium ion battery to help keep the lights on in South Australia.
Shares of Tesla fell 9% on Friday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker’s high-flying stock was overly expensive. “Tesla stock price is too high,” Musk said on Twitter.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla applies to generate electricity in UK</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla created one of the world’s largest lithium-ion batteries for the Australian state grid in 2017.
Tesla has applied for a licence to generate electricity in the UK, documents show.
The US company is mainly known for its electric vehicles but also has operations in battery energy storage and solar panel and solar roof tile manufacturing.
The application, made to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority by Tesla Motors Co., does not specify the reasons for seeking a licence.
It was filed on Tuesday and signed by Evan Rice, Tesla energy products sales director.
Tesla created one of the world’s largest lithium-ion batteries for the Australian state grid in 2017.
Chief executive Elon Musk had said his company would develop the 100-megawatt battery within 100 days of contracts being signed at the end of September, and if it failed to deliver on time he would hand the battery to the South Australia state government for free.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla applies to become UK electricity provider: The Telegraph</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc has applied for a licence to supply electricity in the United Kingdom, The Telegraph reported on Saturday.
The purpose of the licence from the energy regulator may be to introduce the company’s Autobidder platform, the report said, citing a company source. The application did not make clear why Tesla has applied for the licence, The Telegraph reported.
Autobidder is a platform for automated energy trading and is currently being operated at Tesla’s Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia.
Having built a significant battery business in recent years, the carmaker is now preparing to enter the British market with its technology, the paper said, citing industry sources.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
In 2017, the carmaker built world’s largest lithium ion battery to help keep the lights on in South Australia.
Shares of Tesla fell 9% on Friday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker’s high-flying stock was overly expensive. “Tesla stock price is too high,” Musk said on Twitter.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I drove a few miles by back roads this morning from my remote farm in the Upper Exe valley to the garage at Wheddon Cross to fill up with petrol. 
I'm not sure whether, strictly speaking, this was an 'essential' journey as laid down by law.
The tank was still a quarter-full, but I reckoned I had a good excuse ready if I was intercepted by a zealous representative of the Avon and Somerset constabulary.
'Well, actually officer...,' I was going to say, 'I'm planning to pick up the papers as well. 
'I think there may be something in them about the birth of my latest grandchild, Wilfred Johnson.'
As it happened, I reached the garage without being intercepted. I filled up with petrol and bought a full set of the available papers.
I flipped through them before heading for home. Most of them carried a charming front-page photo of Boris's fiancee, Carrie, and the new baby.
'Meet Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson,' urged The Mail on Sunday, for example. 'He's got Daddy's hair!'
I admit I felt, at that moment, overcome with emotion. 
I hadn't had the faintest idea that 'Wilfred', my own father's first name, was even in the running as a candidate for the birth certificate – let alone that 'Wilfred' would end up in pole position.
But there was more to it than that. 
I felt absurdly proud that this tiny infant, safe in his mother's arms, would carry to his dying day my father's own first name and his surname too.
When I got home, I headed off for some moments of quiet reflection in my study, looking out at the sparkling river that flows through the meadow below the house.
Here I was in the very place where my parents after the war had made their home.
They lived here full-time for 40 years. My siblings and I spent our childhood and adolescence here.
What would my father have made of today's news, I wondered. He wasn't a talkative man.
He weighed his words. But I am 100 per cent sure that he would have been pleased, even delighted.
I can imagine him popping down to the Royal Oak in Winsford, ordering a pint and taking his pipe from his mouth (though he was usually wedded to it) to acknowledge proffered congratulations.
Well, Wilfred Johnson The Elder – better known in these parts as 'Johnny' Johnson – is no longer with us to tell us himself what he thinks of recent events. 
So I am going to allow myself the luxury of saying a word or two about the man this new young Wilfred may one day refer to as 'Great-Grandaddy'.
The papers carried a photo of my father and me walking side by side on the track which leads to our farm. I look at him now and I acknowledge how much I owe him.
By any standard, he had a tough start in life. 
His mother, Winifred, died in Bournemouth of puerperal fever four days after he was born. He was brought up by his maternal grandmother.
His own father, Ali Kemal, a Turkish politician, once the Sultan's Minister of the Interior, was kidnapped in Istanbul in 1922 and brutally murdered.
Wilfred himself served the whole of the Second World War in RAF Coastal Command, flying Wellington bombers on long anti-U-boat patrols over the Atlantic.
He survived two crashes, hated post-war urban life with a passion, and came to Exmoor and a hill-farmer's life which couldn't by any stretch of the imagination have been called easy.
Even though it's 27 years since my father died, they still remember him in the village – particularly the time when, coming back to the farm from the pub late one night, he drove his car off the bridge into the river.
He emerged pipe in hand, gruff but unscathed, though the vehicle had to be towed out with the tractor the next day.
I have said that my father was not a talkative man. By that I mean that, he didn't spend a lot of time in conversation.
I cannot recall that we ever had a 'dinner party' at home or indeed that my parents ever went to one, not while they lived on Exmoor anyway.
My father was a farmer. That's what he wanted to be and that – late in life – was what he managed to achieve.
My mother sometimes complained that he spent more time talking to his beloved horse Sunshine than he did to her.
Happily he could ride Sunshine over the hill to the pub, knowing that the 'dear old girl' would be able to find her own way back on the darkest of nights.

    <h5 class="mb-1">With COVID-19, you’re on your own</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometime in 2019, I got a text message from Mallam Abba Kyari, the late chief of staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, who was on a visit to the UK. It was very short: “Simon, I’ll be in London this afternoon. If you have the time, let’s catch up over coffee.” Why not? There were plenty issues of interest to discuss. He was well-rounded: a sociologist, lawyer, former editor and former bank MD. You hardly get such a robust, resourceful and multi-disciplinary assemblage in one person. He never shied away from an argument, even if he would withhold sensitive information for obvious reasons. I often looked forward to these sessions. We always argued like gentlemen.
As a student of development, I like holding private “policy sessions” with top government officials. I like to learn about the challenges to policy development and deployment that may not be in the public domain. I gain deep insights for my commentaries. My chosen path in life is to constructively contribute, from my little corner, to Nigeria’s development. Rather than just saying there is a problem, I love to say there is a solution. While I have no interest in politics (either by election or appointment), I love making inputs into the policy process. I feel gratified whenever my ideas make sense to policy makers. I spent a year studying the role of good governance in development at the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), University of Sussex, UK. It was not by mistake.
When I arrived at the restaurant somewhere in central London for the appointment, Kyari typically welcomed me with a book. It was ‘The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator’, authored by Timothy C. Winegard, a professor of history and political science. It is a fascinating read on the history of the mosquito: how the tiny insect has determined the fates of empires, nations and economies. The mosquito, Winegard wrote, has played a greater role in shaping the human story than any other living thing on this planet. Fun fact: the mosquito has killed an estimated 52 billon people out of the 108 billion that have lived since human existence. That’s nearly 50 percent!
After our usual review of issues around the world — from politics to economy to religion — I tabled the first item on my agenda. I told him I was happy Buhari was paying sustained attention to agriculture. We are all agreed that this was the way to go. At least, we would become self-sufficient in rice sooner or later. “But there are important sectors where I am not feeling the Buhari government,” I said. He looked at me keenly, without attempting to interrupt. I continued: “We are increasingly wearing African print but the fabrics are imported. Buhari is not doing much about the textile industry. Reviving the industry will solve a million problems.” I rested my case.
Let me paraphrase his response: “Well said, Simon. You are thinking textile. I am thinking cotton. We have to revive the comatose cotton industry first. If not, the problem will only be half-solved. If the textile factories are still importing the input, we will be losing out in the value chain. We will still be exporting jobs and also depleting our reserves. We have to be strategic about it. The ministry of trade and investment and the central bank are working on cotton intervention. You can confirm from the minister or the CBN governor.” Later in the year, the CBN announced a loan of N19.18 billion (at a single-digit interest) to cotton producing firms to retool their processing plants.
“You are thinking textile. I am thinking cotton.” I have continued to replay this Kyari line in my head as COVID-19 turns the world upside down. The central message was not lost on me: let us be in control of the value chain as much as possible. Of what use is outsourcing the supply of the raw material when your land can grow cotton, employ Nigerians, conserve your forex and enable a massive cottage industry? We can import the machines and the spare parts since we can’t manufacture them, but why import the cotton? Why not enable cotton farming as part of the entire chain and create a solid, sustainable foundation for the textile industry to fully take off again?
Now that COVID-19 is distorting the world economic order, Kyari’s words have come to mean much more than growing cotton to me. While it makes sense to control the chain of production as much as possible, it is now becoming an imperative for self-preservation. When the chips are down, you are actually on your own. It is “everyman” for himself. With the whole world in trouble, the instinct in every country is to first kill their own coronavirus before helping others to kill theirs. No wonder they tell you in pre-flight announcements that in the “unlikely event” of loss of cabin pressure, fix your own mask first before fixing your child’s. I can see clearly now.
As the pandemic has taught us, relying on imported raw materials or finished products has left many countries vulnerable. As soon as India got hit by the virus, the government announced that it was restricting the export of pharmaceutical products. India is reputed as the largest provider of generic drugs globally. Its pharmaceutical sector supplies over 50 percent of various vaccines used globally, 40 percent of generic medicine in the US and 25 percent of all medicine in the UK, according to Indian Pharmaceuticals Industry Report (April 2019). Over 80 percent of the antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS globally are made in India. Basically, the whole world is at the mercy of India.
Even at that, Indian pharmaceutical companies also rely on raw materials from China, the country where the novel coronavirus was born. China halted export to protect its own people. India had to adjust. Yes, globalisation allows you to have your living room in Ghana and the kitchen in Vietnam, but when trouble starts — as we have seen with the pandemic — you are on your own. American companies with factories in China and other Asian countries are having a rethink. The almighty US having to desperately rely on medical supplies from other countries is something they probably never imagined. We are all seeing the world differently now. We are learning the hard way.
“You are thinking textile. I am thinking cotton.” I don’t know Kyari’s view on globalisation — for some reason, we never got to discuss this throughout our fantastic, decade-long friendship — but I could smell some reservation, perhaps because of our peculiarities. Let me quickly add that I am pro-globalisation — insofar as every country is allowed to protect itself within reasonable limits. But I do not subscribe to the underlying philosophy of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which seeks to limit developing countries to producing just raw materials while forcing them to import finished products under “free trade” rules. If we stick to this, we will be doomed forever.
No country can be an island. That is a given. We will always need one another. No country can produce everything it consumes. But countries are now seeing how vulnerable they are when they are not in considerable control of vital aspects of their economy. US and EU companies like outsourcing production to China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and other Asian countries because of cheap labour and lower taxes. They are learning new lessons. Globalisation has always been under attack: a sizeable number of people have been left behind because of job losses, and the resultant discontent has led to xenophobia and ultra-nationalism. COVID-19 has added another dimension.
“You are thinking textile. I am thinking cotton.” With this COVID-19 experience, I would suggest that Nigerian pharmaceutical companies start thinking seriously about how they can be less dependent on foreign inputs, particularly for the generic drugs. They should start investing heavily in research and development. Let it not be said that Nigerians cannot get paracetamol to buy because a factory in India or China cannot export the raw material. We cannot be in total control of the production chain but let’s reduce our exposure. I don’t know if this partly informed the thinking of Kyari (who died of COVID-19 complications last month) on the textile industry but it must now become a factor.
The big lessons Nigeria needs to learn in all these COVID-19 challenges are not just the perils of globalisation and the uncertainties associated with regional co-operations, or even the dangers of importing cotton to manufacture textile. We should not allow this crisis to waste. Other countries will learn and start doing things differently. We should not be left behind. We need to seriously and urgently rethink how we organise our economy and politics. It would be tragic if this pandemic comes and goes and the only thing Nigerians can remember is the number of dead bodies. We should be able to say we learnt this, we are adopting that, and we are implementing this and that.
For governments, COVID-19 is the ultimate doomsday scenario involving the entire world: health crisis, revenue crisis and socio-economic crisis all rolled into one. Now that we know this is possible, we need not just to prepare but also to adapt. For instance, we are waiting to get test kits from abroad while the Senegalese are producing theirs. We can do it. After all, we are trying to make our own ventilators. Also, we are saying we don’t mind importing herbal remedies from Madagascar. Can’t we produce ours? Our problem is that we think in parts and not in whole. “You are thinking textile. I am thinking cotton.” Remember: when the chips are down, we are on our own.
THE UNEASE
When President Muhammadu Buhari announced that the lockdown would be eased from May 4, I was relieved but apprehensive. The socio-economic tension in the land would be eased. But COVID-19 has not even peaked in Nigeria yet, so we do not know what is in store. Lifting the lockdown can lead to an explosion in cases, by which time we would not be thinking about socio-economic tension again but the avalanche of funerals. As I said in my previous article, we are caught between a rock and a hard place. I would advise Nigerians that in addition to other precautionary measures, they should avoid touching the face with their phones. They should also not spit in public. Tips.
KANO CARNAGE
I’m really worried about Kano state following a litany of “strange deaths” without medical reports. Not so long ago, I saw a video of young men demonstrating and passionately singing “babu korona” (“there is no coronavirus”). I understand the protest was endorsed by the educated and the uneducated. Now that people are dying in large numbers without medical attention — and most importantly, without COVID-19 tests — we are left to panic over what is killing them. Could it be complications from the disease? Could it be some other epidemic? Governor Abdullahi Ganduje always scores F9 in my books. Mind you, I’m a generous marker. Disaster.
HERBAL CURE
Can African herbs cure the coronavirus disease? It’s been an interesting debate since Madagascar President Andry Rajolina launched a herbal remedy weeks ago. Branded COVID-organics, the medicine contains artemisa, a plant used in treating malaria. It was developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research. As long as it is logically proven that it cures the disease, should there be any basis for argument? I grew up in the village and took a lot of herbs to attack common illnesses, such as malaria, and I can testify that they worked. We should support all the remedies that can tackle this deadly disease — as long as they are scientifically certified. Simple.
POVERTY ALLEVIATION
It was nice listening to Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo at a virtual conference on Tuesday. He said the federal government is looking beyond conditional cash transfer in tackling the poverty challenge. He also said something about support for informal sector. Given that most Nigerians operate in the informal sector, this is great news. However, I still want more work done on the small and medium scale businesses. It is not so much about financial support — which is equally important. But those who want to do business are being discouraged by draconian and extortionist government agencies. I have written a lot on this. Solving this problem alone can grow the economy. Urgent.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jesse Keith Whitley talks new music, remembers late Keith Whitley </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This song will be released on May 9, which coincides with the 31st anniversary of his father's death. "When I heard the work tape that I wanted to cut this song, but I had no idea that it was going to be a single until we got it done," he said.
"We ended up choosing 'Try To Change My Ways' as the single and I think it pertains to me," he said. "To come out of the gate with a brand new album and brand new single, that's the song to do it with."
On being an artist in the digital age, he said, "During this time, it's nice. There are so many people home right now and they are listening to new music. Sadly, we are not playing shows right now, but luckily, we are in the digital era, so we are still okay."
Regarding his musical inspirations, he said, "I'm a visual person. When I listen to music, I am almost picturing a music video in my head. If I am hearing a song, I am living that video in my head. What inspires me most about music is being able to touch people with it. Sometimes, I listen to songs and I get sad, happy, or mad, and that can be inspiring for anybody."
For young and aspiring country singer-songwriters, he said, "Get used to the word 'no' and don't let it knock you down. That's all right because not everybody is going to like what's being done. There is room for everybody. Find your niche and work your craft. Hone it, work it and perfect your craft. Never stop."
He shared that his father, the late but great Keith Whitley was a profound musical influence in his life. "Vocally, his music and my music are very different but at the same time, they are somewhat similar. He was absolutely an influence on my music for sure," he said, prior to noting that he would love to someday see his late father in the Country Music Hall of Fame. "I think it would be deserved," he added.
For his fans, he concluded about the new single, "I hope the fans like it. We have been working really hard on this new album, and the single. We've put our hearts in everything, and I hope the fans enjoy listening to it as much as we enjoyed putting it together."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why a 'dyed-in-the-wool libertarian' decided to download COVIDSafe app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Had you asked Ken Hanvey a year ago to download a data-gathering app because the federal government insisted on it, he'd have thought you quite mad.
But in the age of coronavirus, this 61-year-old "dyed-in-the-wool libertarian" pounced at the opportunity to click yes to COVIDSafe.
"I was probably the second person to sign up," he said yesterday from Brunswick, where he was enjoying a rare, socially-distanced takeaway coffee with his daughters, Joanne and Michelle.
"The reason being is that these are my daughters. I'm also a grandfather. That isolation, not being able to see people, is hard. If (the app) is a transition to these restrictions being lifted, then I'm for it."
Joanne and Michelle were, like most Australians, yet to download the app.
"Half of me is thinking that my data is going somewhere, though I do know Google is doing that anyway," Joanne, 28, said.
"I'm not totally opposed. I haven't really had a good think about it yet."
The Hanveys are common family story across the country. Statistics show more than half of Australians support the app. While some are open in their advocacy, a niggling sense of distrust has more sitting on the fence.
Some, like former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, are openly hostile.
Mario Bojilov, who teaches data and cyber security for the MBS academy, said the COVIDSafe app was far less than intrusive than foreign mega companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, which are used by millions of Australians every day without a second thought.
"Each one of us is a data point. The fact we get so much stuff for free is because they can monetise us in a different way," he said.
"Let's say we use the [COVIDSafe app]. It will tell you who you have been in contact with, or nearby, and if these people are infected with COVID-19. Now, there are some legal safeguards around that and the source code for the app will published for researchers to investigate.
"But when you think about Google, Facebook and all the others, it's a different story. Google knows what you think better than you do yourself. Google remembers what we were thinking 10 years ago when we did that search, and it's stored on the Google servers.
"It's insights are much, much deeper. It knows preferences for purchases, politics, you name it."
Federal and state governments are also already using a trove of anonymised data sources to track population movements in the fight against coronavirus, including NBN usage, phone data and toll road figures.
The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet alone lists 10 data sources it uses to determine where and how people are moving and their responses to social distancing measures.
The government then compares the data against international trends to determine the effectiveness of Australia's strategies.
A spokeswoman stressed the information was public, aggregated and anonymous.
The Andrews government did not respond to questions about what data sources it had used.
The Sunday Age revealed last month the Australian government had secured data from telecommunications provider Vodafone used to show patterns in people's movement in the bigger cities compared with the same time last year. This information was also aggregrated and anonymous, the government said.
The NSW Information and Privacy Commission said on Thursday the use of "de-identified data" could provide important insights into how to manage the pandemic and the need for other measures.
"However, it is essential that the risks of re-identification are addressed and mitigated," it said.
Rajan Venkataraman from Civil Liberties Australia, which does not in principle oppose COVIDSafe so long as rigid safeguards are in place, said people should maintain a healthy scepticism about governments' use of big data.
"We would call upon all departments and federal and state governments to be upfront and transparent about all the data sets they're using and ensure all data collected is anonymised and aggregated," he said.
Back in Brunswick, Margaret and Bruce, who asked their last names not be used, were yet to be convinced about the COVIDSafe app.
"I need more information about it," Margaret said, adding the government's early models showing tens of thousands of COVID-19 deaths in Australia had diminished their confidence in talking heads behind lecterns.
"Otherwise there's no reason not to. It takes a minute. But we haven't done it. I think Scott Morrison telling us there'll be restrictions until we get the app is peculiar. He's treating us like school kids with this."

    <h5 class="mb-1">India makes government tracing app mandatory for all workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government on Friday said India – the country with the largest number of people in lockdown – would extend its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the Covid-19 illness but allow “considerable relaxations” in lower-risk districts.
As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu – meaning Health Bridge – a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country’s National Informatics Centre.
The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for Covid-19 or deemed to be at high risk.
“Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public,” India’s Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late on Friday.
It will the responsibility of the heads of companies and organisations “to ensure 100% coverage of this app among the employees,” said the ministry.
Officials at India’s technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people.
The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India’s smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data.
The app’s compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stresses that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app.
“Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body,” said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla.
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.
The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used “only for administering necessary medical interventions”.
On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain the spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.
India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government on Friday said India - the country with the largest number of people in lockdown - would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 illness, but allow “considerable relaxations” in lower-risk districts.
As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu - meaning Health Bridge - a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country’s National Informatics Centre. The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for COVID-19 or deemed to be at high risk.
“Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public,” India’s Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late on Friday.
It will the responsibility of the heads of companies and organizations “to ensure 100 per cent coverage of this app among the employees,” the ministry said.
Officials at India’s technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people.
The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India’s smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data.
The app’s compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app.
“Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body,” said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla.
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.
The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used “only for administering necessary medical interventions”.
On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.
India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Explained: Fighting Covid-19 with phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the world and India battle the novel coronaviruspandemic, India has all but made it mandatory to download and use a mobile phone application called Aarogya Setu developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.
According to new guidelines for the extended lockdown beyond May 3, use of Aarogya Setu is required for all employees, private and public, with the head of the organisation made responsible for ensuring 100% coverage among employees. Earlier in the week, all central government employees were asked to download the app and, beginning Friday, it has been made mandatory for everyone crossing the Delhi-Gurgaon border.
How does a mobile phone app help in the control of a viral epidemic?
The Indian government has adopted the strategy of aggressive and elaborate ‘contact tracing’ (along with testing) as the key to controlling the disease and restricting its spread.
Aarogya Setu is a contact tracing app that uses GPS coordinates and Bluetooth data to track the user’s location, both on their own, as well as relative to other users, to establish whether they have come physically close to someone suffering from COVID-19, and to make an assessment of their risk of infection.
Many countries are using mobile apps to track the spread and progress of the disease. South Korea and Singapore were the early starters. In South Korea, the app was rolled out by private developers; in Singapore, it was an initiative of the government.
The use of these apps has been credited with a significant extent for these countries’ success in flattening the disease curve. The outbreak in these countries began relatively early, but as of the end of April, South Korea had under 11,000 cases and 247 deaths, while Singapore had 15,000-odd cases and only 14 deaths. Their case fatality rate and deaths per 1 lakh population were very low — 2.3% and 0.48, and 0.1% and 0.25 respectively, according to data on the Johns Hopkins University pandemic tracking dashboard.
China has been using health apps to ward off a potential second wave of infection. Italy, which seems to have got over the worst of its crisis, is working on an app, and Germany has backed a joint Google-Apple initiative to build a contact tracing API. The same initiative is under discussion in France, amid disagreement over the amount of data to be collected.
In the UK, a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app is under testing. In Israel, the NSO group, which built the Pegasus surveillance software last year, has tested a contact tracing app, even though an initiative by the Israeli police to use mobile phone location to enforce quarantine measures has been blocked by Parliament over privacy concerns.

Several health experts have argued that a key tool at governments’ disposal to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, and which was not around during the 1918 Spanish Flu, is the ability to harness digital technologies to track the spread. At the same time, deployment of contact tracing apps by governments or public health authorities has added to the debate on online privacy and personal data protection.
While some of these apps have sought sweeping access to smartphone functionalities, others stop just short of that, collecting and uploading data without specifically obtaining the consent of users in every case.
So, which countries already have such apps, and what data do they collect?
There are private initiatives in several countries, but the main government-backed apps are, apart from India, in Poland, Singapore, Iceland, and Australia. Each of these apps requires a specific set of permissions from users, and have different policies on how they store, maintain and share data collected from users.
A comparison of the terms and conditions of their use is in the chart. This analysis is based on the Android versions of the apps; the iOS versions too, need similar permissions.
India’s Aarogya Setu seeks nine sets of permissions (in the chart, the entry on Bluetooth refers to two sets of permissions) — including for network-based location, GPS location, receiving data from the Internet, running at device start-up, and preventing the device from ‘sleeping’. The number of permissions sought by Aarogya Setu is higher than only Australia’s COVIDSafe app, which does not seek permission for network-based location or for receiving data from the Internet.
The reasons for seeking particular permissions range from the purpose and design of a certain app, to the data that the app’s developer intends to collect. For example, the “prevent device from sleeping” permission, which all apps analysed for this report (except Australia’s COVIDSafe) seek, is intended to ensure the app is able to keep the smartphone’s CPU awake to complete work.
Android devices are designed to fall asleep when idle, to prevent draining of the battery. But some apps need to work in the background, and for this, they seek permission to wake up the phone’s screen or CPU.
Again, given that Poland’s Home Quarantine app is meant to ensure those under quarantine stay that way, it periodically asks people to upload a selfie, which is geotagged. Upon failure by a user, police are notified. To make this effective, the app seeks access to camera and storage.
How exactly does Aarogya Setu work?
India’s official COVID-19 contact tracing app functions in the following manner:
When someone registers on the app, their name, phone number, age, sex, profession and the countries they visited in the last 30 days are collected, and stored on a server run by the Government of India. This is stored with a unique ID, which is used to identify the user in all subsequent app-related transactions. This digital ID is also associated with any information that may subsequently be uploaded.
At time of registration, the person’s location details are collected from the device, and uploaded to the server. For the app to do its job, users must keep the location and Bluetooth features switched on at all times.
When two registered users come within Bluetooth range of each other, typically less than 10 metres, the apps on their respective devices will automatically exchange the digital IDs and record the time and GPS location at which the contact took place.
This information collected at this point is stored locally on the devices. If one of these registered users tests positive for COVID-19, the information will be uploaded from their mobile device, and stored on the server.
According to Aarogya Setu’s privacy policy, the app continuously collects the user’s location data and stores it on the device, creating a record of all the places visited at 15-minute intervals. Further, every time a user conducts a self-assessment on the app, tick-marking COVID-19 symptoms, the app marks this user Yellow, Orange or Green, based in a reducing order of threat, with Green meaning the person is safe.
What about questions of user privacy?
One of the red flags being raised about Aarogya Setu is that it collects a single blanket consent from the user at the beginning, and the details of what this consent would be used for, is included in the privacy policy. This is not the case with similar apps in other countries. The privacy policy of Australia’s COVIDSafe notes, for example:
“We cannot access any contact data stored on a device, or share this with health officials, unless and until a COVIDSafe user consents to upload the data to the data store.” The COVIDSafe app is based on a source code from Singapore’s TraceTogether app, but differs from the original app in several ways.
Around the world, questions have also been raised about what happens to the data and the app itself once the pandemic recedes.
Policies of these apps have detailed clauses on deletion of data. Iceland’s Rakning C-19 app says phone numbers it stored will be deleted when the need for contact tracing is over, and all location data will be deleted from the database 14 days after uploading.
COVIDSafe gives an option to its users to request deletion of data held in its database; this is in addition to all contact data being automatically deleted after 21 days.
Aarogya Setu says that “all personal information collected. at the time of registration will be retained for as long as your account remains in existence and for such period thereafter as required under any law for the time being in force”. It will, however, purge all data stored on the app that is not uploaded to the server after 30 days.
Singapore’s TraceTogether app says that on request, it will delete contact information and identifiers from its servers, thus rendering “meaningless all data that your phone has exchanged with other phones, because that data will no longer be associated with you”.
How many people are currently using Aarogya Setu?
The Android and iOS versions of the app have been downloaded more than 75 million times, according to official data.
While Aarogya Setu started off as a voluntary exercise to top the government’s efforts of containing the COVID-19 outbreak, it is gradually inching towards becoming one of the mainstays in the battle. The government has mandated all central government employees and officers to download the app. Only if they are marked “safe” or at “low-risk” by the app should they commute to work, the government order said.
This is in addition to several private companies asking employees to download the app as they prepare for lifting of the lockdown. It is possible that a ‘safe’ status on Aarogya Setu could become a formal or informal ‘permit’ to enter public buildings and spaces in the future.
There is one important point to consider regarding penetration of the app, however – which is directly linked to its effectiveness.

Officials from most of the governments rolling out these apps have pointed out that the key factor that will determine the success of these projects would be the rapid emergence of a critical mass of users. The apps, including Aarogya Setu, must have a penetration of at least 50%. This means that unless half the population of the country downloads the contact tracing app, the intended outcome will not be achieved.
While this is a reason for governments to aggressively push for downloads, critics have argued that this particular response to the pandemic opens out a vast space for intrusive surveillance by state agencies, threatening the privacy of large sections of their users.
The critics have said that while some of the features that do not necessarily adhere to all privacy norms are all right as long as the app is voluntary, governments may begin to make the apps mandatory in order to achieve the necessary penetration. This could mean using the app to give a safety clearance to individuals before they use public transport, enter their workplaces or even step out of their residential premises.

Hackers put more than half a million login details for the teleconferencing app Zoom on the dark web, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.
The logins were put up for sale at 1 pence (1.25 cents) each and were discovered and bought by cybersecurity intelligence company Cyble, the paper said. Cyble purchased the logins from a Russian-speaking person on the Telegram messaging service, which allows anonymous messaging.
Zoom Video Communications Inc. has seen global usage of its service surge during coronavirus shutdowns, but has come under increasing pressure over vulnerabilities in the app’s software encryption. The company has been sued amid accusations it hid flaws in its app and has seen cases of online trolls sneak in and disrupt web meetings with profanity and pornography.
Zoom Goes From Conferencing App to the Pandemic’s Social Network
Zoom’s shares have more than doubled this year alongside its meteoric rise in popularity, but privacy and cybersecurity experts have expressed skepticism. From Elon Musk’s SpaceX to New York City’s Department of Education, agencies around the world have begun to ban usage of the app amid security concerns.
It’s common for web services to be targeted by activity which involves bad actors testing large numbers of already compromised credentials from other platforms to see if they’ve been re-used, a Zoom spokesperson said in a statement.
Zoom also said it’s hired multiple intelligence firms to find these password dumps and the tools used to create them, as well as a company that has shut down thousands of websites attempting to trick users into downloading malware or giving up their credentials.
“We continue to investigate, are locking accounts we have found to be compromised, asking users to change their passwords to something more secure, and are looking at implementing additional technology solutions to bolster our efforts,” the spokesperson said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 app Aarogya Setu mandatory for all employees, says govt</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aarogya Setu, the government's Covid-19-tracing app, has to be used in state-owned and private offices and employers will have to ensure it is.
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Friday said India would extend its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from May 4 to battle the spread of coronavirus that causes the Covid-19 illness, but allow "considerable relaxations" in lower-risk districts.
As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, government last month launched the app Aarogya Setu, meaning Health Bridge, a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country's National Informatics Centre. The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for Covid-19 or deemed to be at high risk.
"Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public," the MHA said in a directive late on Friday.
It will be the responsibility of the heads of companies and organisations "to ensure 100 per cent coverage of this app among the employees," the ministry said.

Officials at India's technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people.
The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India's smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data.
The app's compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app.
"Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body," said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla.
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.
The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used "only for administering necessary medical interventions".
On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.
India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The government launched the Aarogya Setu app in early April as a voluntary application, with its use being encouraged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and establishments such as CBSE
The government has made the use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all public and private sector employees.  
The Union Home Ministry declared the use of India's own contact tracing app mandatory as part of fresh guidelines rolled out along with the lockdown phase 3 to check the spread of coronavirus.
The government has also said that companies and organisations will have to achieve 100 per cent compliance with the order.
Besides, office space, the ministry has also made the app mandatory for people residing in a containment zone.
The government launched the Aarogya Setu app in early April as a voluntary application, with its use being encouraged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and establishments such as CBSE.
The app communicates with nearby phones using Bluetooth and gathers their GPS location data. Once a user has downloaded the app, it asks for continuous Bluetooth access and location data.
By using the app, it is possible to keep track of all the people who came near or in contact with a person, who has been infected with the novel coronavirus.
The app also asks for information that includes questions related to a person's age, gender, name, health status and travel history. It also checks if the user belongs to any one of the exempted categories of professionals amid the lockdown period.
After processing all this information, the Aarogya Setu app also details whether or not the user is at risk of contracting coronavirus infection.
Steps to download and use Aarogya Setu app:
1. After downloading the app, the user needs to read and agree with the terms and conditions to register.
2. The User will need to submit his/her mobile number for verification, after which an OTP will be sent to his/her registered number.
3. Post-registration, the user can fill in personal details such as his/her name, age, profession, and country travel outside within the last 30 days.
4. The app asks users whether or not they are ready to volunteer in times of need.
5. Users can also do a self-assessment test after providing all the necessary details. The app lets users know about the chances of their infection risk.

In containment zones, the government has mandated “100 per cent Aarogya Setu app”, however, it isn’t clear whether the order will also be applicable to residents in such areas or be limited only to office and workspaces. India is the only country where the download of contact tracing application has been mandated such a measure. “This app is not secure, its source code is not open for examination and its security vulnerabilities are already being exploited,” technology lawyer and founder of Software Freedom Law Centre, Mishi Choudhary, told The Indian Express. Earlier as well, individuals and organisations have raised concerns about surveillance and violation of data privacy as the government launched the application. Food delivery workers and some other service providers, as well as all federal government employees were already mandated to use the application. 
“Once installed in a smartphone through an easy and user-friendly process, the app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone. The app can then calculate the risk of infection based on sophisticated parameters if any of these contacts are tested positive,” the government had said in April 2 upon the launch of the app. 
With the fresh government directive, concerns regarding privacy have resurfaced. In fact, the app has “uncanny similarities between Aarogya Setu and Fleming, the new Covid-19 tracking product developed by the NSO group, the infamous spyware maker and developer of Pegasus,” Salman Waris, a partner at TechLegis and head of their TMT (Technology, Media and Telecommunication) and IP (Internet Protocol) practices, told the newspaper. There were also some media reports which said that the government now plans to make the app mandatory for travelling via public transit.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aarogya Setu app must for all office-goers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: As the government extended the nationwide shutdown for another two weeks on Friday, it made the Aarogya Setu app mandatory to download for all office goers — in both public and private sectors. Looking to impose stricter contact tracing surveillance to contain the pandemic, the government also made the app mandatory for all those living in containment zones.
On Wednesday,  all central government employees had been asked to immediately download the app and come to office only when it shows they are ‘safe’ or ‘low-risk’.
Though the Ministry of Home Affairs has extended the shutdown till May 17, it has allowed more relaxations. Wedding functions, which were not permitted earlier, have now been allowed  in lockdown 3.0, but with a limit of not more than 50 people. Funerals will continue to have a limit of 20 people. Besides these two social commitments, all other social, religious gatherings etc. will continue to remain banned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 proximity alert app may be available within weeks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The government announced this week that it is ramping up its efforts to combat the virus over the weekend by starting a community antibody testing programme, increasing swab testing and doubling its manual contact tracing resources.
Tony Moretta, chief executive of Digital Jersey, confirmed that discussions are also being held about introducing a contact tracing app – including with the technology wing of the NHS.
Such an app would ‘trace’ interactions between smartphone users and alert those who may have been in close contact with someone who has been a confirmed case of Covid-19 infection.
Mr Moretta, who has been seconded to the government during the crisis as an implementation director, said that a tracing app was something that would become useful as lockdown restrictions are eased.
‘On contact tracing it is worth saying that the first step is to increase the ability of the current manual contact tracing,’ he said.
‘So there is going to be a more than doubling of the staff locations they operate from and also an improvement in the technical platform that they are using. That is happening over the next couple of weeks.
‘The tracing app is something for further down the line. We are in conversation with lots of people, including NHSX, and are looking at developments.
‘In the next week or so we will have a better idea of what the Google and Apple specs are. At the moment, we have developed some functional specifications as to what we would like to see in an app in Jersey.’
He added that the next step would be to ‘evaluate the options’ and they would look to use technology being implemented elsewhere.
‘I would say that contact tracing is an area that is still quite hyped at the moment. There are very few places actually using a tracing app at scale,’ he said.
‘NHSX is still piloting theirs and think they are still three weeks away. We are not looking to reinvent the wheel for Jersey and hopefully we can look around and take the best we can find in terms of what we need here.’
Mr Moretta said that he believed there could be opportunities for Jersey as a testbed or case study for testing and tracing programmes because its island status gives it a controlled environment.
‘Michael Gove was talking about the UK’s offshore islands’ advantages and there was a story that they were looking to test the NHSX app on the Isle of Wight,’ he said.
‘He said that because islands can control who is coming in and going out they might be one of the best places to trial monitoring and testing and be the first to start to exit lockdown.’
Steve Skelton, the government’s director of strategy and innovation, agreed that islands had their advantages but said the priority at this time was the health and safety of residents.
‘We have hopefully seen a tailing off in the rate of infections and that is much harder to achieve if you are not in control of who is coming in and out of a place,’ he said.
‘So there are natural benefits from being in small island communities. But going forward, the principle objective is to deal with the pandemic in a way that promotes the health and safety and wellbeing of Islanders.
‘Anything beyond that, we would have to think about at the time.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aarogya Setu app now ‘mandatory’ in all workspaces: Govt</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the fresh guidelines extending the lockdown till May 17, the government has made the use of its contact tracing app, Aarogya Setu, mandatory for use by all employees of public and private organisations.
“It shall be the responsibility of the head of the respective organisations to ensure 100 per cent coverage of this app among the employees,” the Ministry of Home Affairs(MHA) said in its notification.
In containment zones, the government has mandated “100 per cent Aarogya Setu app”, without clarifying whether the order will also be applicable to residents in such areas or be limited only to office and workspaces.
“The pandemic is global, making contact tracing aided by technology attractive to every country. While everywhere else these apps are voluntary, India is the only country to mandate such a measure. This app is not secure, its source code is not open for examination and its security vulnerabilities are already being exploited,” technology lawyer and founder of Software Freedom Law Centre, Mishi Choudhary, said.
Aaroyga Setu, the government’s contact tracing app for tracking patients with Covid-19, and alerting others if they came in the proximity of those patients, has been under the lens for being invasive and violating data privacy norms.
According to a statement released on April 2 by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, the app will track its users’ “interaction with others”, and will alert the authorities if there was any suspicion of the user having been in contact with an infected person.
“Once installed in a smartphone through an easy and user-friendly process, the app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone. The app can then calculate the risk of infection based on sophisticated parameters if any of these contacts are tested positive,” the government had then said.
With the latest notification directing the mandatory installation of the app on smartphones, the privacy concerns with regards to the app have resurfaced.
“The privacy concerns are being highlighted again more so in relation to the uncanny similarities between Aarogya Setu and Fleming, the new Covid-19 tracking product developed by the NSO group, the infamous spyware maker and developer of Pegasus,” Salman Waris, a partner at TechLegis and head of their TMT (Technology, Media and Telecommunication) and IP (Internet Protocol) practices, said.
The NSO group’s app Fleming uses an advance mapping tool to track the spread of Covid-19 in real-time.
“It is clear that the Aarogya Setu app uses a similar mechanism as Fleming for tracking Covid-19. The app also tracks where people go, who they meet and for how long they stay at a particular place. Both can filter the movements of a certain patient by their last location or whether they visited any meeting places like public squares or office buildings,” Waris said.
IT ministry officials had last week also hinted at using the app as an e-pass for movement during the curfew hours. It had during the last week mandated that all employees in the government sector install the app.
“Most countries have opted for a data minimalistic and decentralised approach, whereas Aarogya Setu app goes against these accepted principles. By mandating all employers to ensure the adoption of the app by their employees, the government has made a mockery of the consent principle as the terms and the privacy policy of the app are now enforced on the people and they do not have any choice,” Prasanth Sugathan, legal director at SFLC told The Indian Express.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SpaceX to bring astronauts to short-handed Space Station for longer stay</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two NASA astronauts gearing up to ride SpaceX’s new space taxi will now be on a mission planned to last more than a month, instead of a week, to help the short-handed crew aboard the International Space Station, the U.S. space agency said on Friday.
The launch is scheduled for May 27 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida and will arrive at the ISS the following day. The mission, SpaceX’s first carrying humans, marks the company’s climactic test before NASA can certify its Crew Dragon capsule for regular operational flights.
Space Shuttle veterans Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley are set to be the first astronauts launched from American soil since the shuttle program was terminated in 2011. 
The mission’s extension allows Hurley and Behnken to help swap out the station’s batteries, a task that requires an outside spacewalk the current U.S. resident on the ISS, Chris Cassidy, could not do alone. 
The two astronauts embraced the mission extension, with Hurley saying it could last anywhere from one to four months.
“I think that it being in the summertime, hopefully with a May 27 launch date, we’re hitting a good time so that my son will be able to follow the mission a little more closely than he would if he was in school,” Behnken said.
SpaceX and Boeing Co BA.N. have been awarded a combined $7 billion to build separate crew transportation systems under the Commercial Crew Program, NASA’s flagship campaign to use the private sector for ISS missions and curb its reliance on Russia’s Soyuz rocket. 
“We currently are supporting the station with the bare minimum,” NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said on Friday. “Without the presence of Behnken and Hurley, we otherwise would likely defer such an operation until additional NASA crew members are available.”
Kirk Shireman, NASA’s ISS program manager, told reporters on Friday that the agency is basing the length of Hurley and Behnken’s mission on how quickly SpaceX can finish preparations on its next capsule.
Delays with development of both SpaceX and Boeing vehicles have led NASA to extend its reliance on Russia, forcing the space agency to buy additional seats on the Soyuz rocket to ferry more astronauts to space.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SpaceX to bring astronauts to short-handed Space Station for longer stay</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two NASA astronauts gearing up to ride SpaceX's new space taxi will now be on a mission planned to last more than a month, instead of a week, to help the short-handed crew aboard the International Space Station, the U.S. space agency said on Friday.
The launch is scheduled for May 27 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida and will arrive at the ISS the following day. The mission, SpaceX's first carrying humans, marks the company's climactic test before NASA can certify its Crew Dragon capsule for regular operational flights.
Space Shuttle veterans Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley are set to be the first astronauts launched from American soil since the shuttle program was terminated in 2011.
The mission's extension allows Hurley and Behnken to help swap out the station's batteries, a task that requires an outside spacewalk the current U.S. resident on the ISS, Chris Cassidy, could not do alone.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA target historic spaceflight despite pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NASA and SpaceX said Friday they were pressing ahead with plans to launch astronauts to space from US soil for the first time in nearly a decade later on this month, despite the coronavirus pandemic.
Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, both veterans of the Space Shuttle program that was shuttered in 2011, will blast off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida on May 27.
Should the mission succeed, the US will have achieved its goal of no longer having to buy seats on Russian Soyuz rockets to give its astronauts rides to the International Space Station (ISS).
It is also an important stage in NASA’s new economic model: the space agency has spent billions on contracts with both SpaceX and Boeing to develop spaceships that will each have to make six round trips to the ISS.
The model is supposed to save taxpayers from financial black holes of past programs, as well as some still to come notably the giant Space Launch System rocket that is supposed to take NASA back to the Moon but is plagued by cost overrun and scheduling delays.
NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told reporters that the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule will be only the fifth class of US spacecraft to take humans into orbit, after the storied Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle programs.
“If you look globally, this will be the ninth time in history when we put humans on a brand new spacecraft,” said Bridenstine.
“We’re going to do it here in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. I’m going to tell you this is a high priority mission for the United States of America,” he added.
Behnken and Hurley, who have been training for the “Demo-2” mission for years, will dock with the International Space Station (ISS) and remain there for between one to four months, depending on when the next mission takes place, said NASA’s, Steve Stich.
Crew Dragon is able to remain in orbit for around four months (119 days).
Hurley, who was the pilot on the last Space Shuttle mission, admitted it was “disappointing” that the launch won’t be a public affair, with crowds discouraged from gathering at Cape Canaveral to witness the spectacle.
“We won’t have the luxury of our family and friends being there at Kennedy to watch the launch but it’s obvious, the right thing to do in the current environment,” he said.
– A win for SpaceX –
The mission is a major milestone for SpaceX, the company founded by Elon Musk, who also leads and founded Tesla.
His firm, which was started in 2002, has now overtaken aerospace behemoth Boeing, which failed in the uncrewed demonstration mission of its Starliner spacecraft last year and will have to start over.
SpaceX, which has received billions of dollars from NASA since the late 2000s, has been supplying cargo to the ISS since 2012 and has established itself as the leader in the private space sector thanks to its reusable rocket, the Falcon 9.
“I’ll feel a little relief when they’re in orbit, I’ll feel more relief when they get to the station and then obviously, I will start sleeping again when they’re back safely on the planet Earth,” said Gwynne Shotwell, the company’s chief operating officer.
The pandemic has, naturally, impacted the program, but Shotwell said all precautions were being taken to protect the astronauts.
“We are ensuring that only essential personnel is near them. They’re wearing masks and gloves. We’re cleaning the training facility twice daily.
“I think we’re really doing a great job to ensure that we are not impacting the safety or the health of the astronauts’ lives.”
Half of SpaceX’s engineers have been teleworking, and on the day of the launch, NASA personnel in the mission control room will be spaced six feet apart.
Takeoff is scheduled for 4:42 pm (2042 GMT) on May 27, with space station docking scheduled about 19 hours later, on May 28.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA Will Pick One Of These Three Astronaut Lander Concepts For 2024 Moon Mission</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As NASA prepares to return humans to the Moon in 2024, the space agency has decided to take the private route, selecting three U.S. companies to develop an astronaut landing system.
NASA announced yesterday that Blue Origin, Dynetics, and SpaceX will receive a combined $US967 ($1,484) million in funding to develop a human landing system for the Artemis Moon missions.
“This is the first time since the Apollo era that NASA has direct funding for a human landing system, and now we have companies on contract to do the work for the Artemis program,” said NASA chief Jim Bridenstine in a NASA press release.
This money will not be distributed evenly, however, as Blue Origin, led by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, will get $US579 ($889) million, reports Spaceflight Now. Dynetics will receive $US253 ($388) million, and SpaceX will get $US135 ($207) million.
Interestingly, Boeing’s lunar lander was not selected by NASA, so that’s probably done as a concept.
A human landing system, or HLS, must safely deliver astronauts to the lunar surface, sustain them for around a week, and then return them back into space. NASA will provide the means of delivering astronauts to space, via its upcoming Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion Capsule. Once in lunar orbit, astronauts would transfer to an awaiting Moon lander.
These companies now have 10 months to refine their concepts, as the contract period ends in February 2021. NASA personnel will work closely with each company, offering their expertise. At the end of this stage, NASA will select projects for demonstration missions and ultimately decide which lander gets to deliver astronauts to the Moon in 2024.
As SpaceNews reports, however, losing bids won’t just be tossed into the junk pile, as they could be used for future Artemis missions. NASA obviously wants technical proficiency and safety in its technical assets, but it also wants affordability. Not all of these projects are equal in terms of financial sustainability, so while a specific solution may be chosen for 2024, that doesn’t necessarily mean it will be allowed to continue over the long haul, as NASA plans on multiple Artemis missions to various spots around the Moon.
Interestingly, the selections are notable in that they all feature very different design architectures.
Blue Origin’s Integrated Lander Vehicle (ILV) will consist of three stages and be delivered to space by the company’s own New Glenn Rocket System and United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Launch System. Developmental assistance will be provided by Draper (flight avionics), Lockheed Martin (ascent module), and Northrop Grumman (transfer stage). Blue Origin will build the descent module.
ILV is the most Apollo-like of the concepts and represents the safest route to a lunar landing in 2024. With its hefty price tag, however, it may be the least sustainable option for the duration of the Artemis program.
The Dynetics Human Landing System (DHLS) will be an all-in-one module with both landing and take-off capabilities. DHLS would launch onboard a ULA Vulcan rocket. The company is outsourcing to no less than 25 partners, including Sierra Nevada Corporation. Here’s how Dynetics describes the system:
It’s a super-sleek design, but probably something that won’t be ready for 2024. That said, DHLS might be a viable consideration for NASA later this decade.
Of the three vendors, SpaceX is least likely to be ready for 2024, given the complexity of its design. The Elon Musk-led company wants to use its Starship concept, which would serve as a fully integrated lander and take-off vehicle. SpaceX has had some setbacks in testing, but the system passed an important test earlier this week.
This gigantic tin can would be a radical departure from traditional lander concepts (as far as any of these can be called “traditional”), requiring sophisticated descent capabilities and a complex life support system—not to mention an elevator and crane for depositing astronauts and supplies to the lunar surface. 
But as the covid-19 pandemic continues with no end in sight, NASA’s already-tight 2024 deadline seems increasingly in jeopardy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA begs spectators for astronaut launch: Please stay home!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NASA and SpaceX on Friday urged spectators to stay home for the first home launch of astronauts in nearly a decade because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Top officials warned the public against traveling to Florida for the May 27 launch of two NASA astronauts aboard a SpaceX rocket to the International Space Station.
It will be the first launch of astronauts from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in nine years — ever since the last space shuttle flight in 2011. It also will be the first attempt by a private company to fly astronauts to orbit.
For space space shuttle launches, hundreds of thousands of spectators would descend on Kennedy Space Center and nearby beaches, said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine.
 “The challenge that we’re up against right now is we want to keep everybody safe,” he said. “And so we’re asking people not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center, and I will tell you that makes me sad to even say it. Boy, I wish we could make this into something really spectacular.”
NASA turned to private companies in the wake of the space shuttle program to get cargo to the space station. Next up are the crew deliveries. Russian Soyuz capsules, meanwhile, have been the sole means of crew transportation to the orbiting lab.
Boeing also is working to launch astronauts under NASA’s commercial crew program; its first crew flight is still months — if not a year — away.

Apple is doing its part to slow the spread of the coronavirus by releasing a software update that makes it easier for smartphone users to log in without taking off face masks.
As governments across the globe are mandating that people don protective gear in public, a new operating system will improve the experience of unlocking an iPhone through Face ID while wearing a face mask, as seen in a Twitter video.
The clips, posted yesterday by Apple software developers, show that iPhones with iOS 13.5 Beta will automatically be prompted to use the manual passcode entry if using Face ID while wearing a face covering.
This way, users don’t have to potentially expose themselves to disease by taking off their face mask to log in. It also eliminates the hassle of having to physically locate the passcode entry option.
Apple hopes that the improvement will reduce the spread of COVID-19 among those who log in to their phones multiple times per day.
Apple’s iOS 13.5 software is projected to be available in the coming weeks, although it’s unclear if the face mask-detecting function will be in the update’s final version, reports TechCrunch.
A recent Australian study found that the average smartphone is riddled with hundreds of strains with bacteria.
“People have to understand that mobile phones are Trojan horses for microbial presence,” said Dr. Lotti Tajouri of Brisbane’s Bond University. The molecular expert added that even if you wash your hands hundreds of times, “if you then touch a contaminated phone, you are contaminating yourself all over again.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple's iOS Update Will Make It Easier for Face ID Users to Unlock Their Phones While Using Masks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple's iOS 13.5 update, expected to be released in the next few weeks, will also include a new contact tracing application programming interface, which makes it possible for users to anonymously find out whether they have been exposed to someone with the novel coronavirus.
Some iPhone users have shared videos on Twitter showing a new feature in the latest version of the upcoming update that will make it easier to unlock one's iPhone without having to remove face coverings.
The change is subtle, whereas before Face ID only tried to recognize a user's face once before asking for a PIN, now Face ID tries to recognize a face a couple of times. A user can also swipe up from the bottom of their iPhone's screen to go straight to the passcode field.
To become a beta tester of the new feature, one needs to visit the Apple Beta Software Program site, sign up and follow the instructions. Users have to download a device profile, after which iOS 13.5 is available for installation.
As of 2 May, 3,272,202 people have contracted the novel coronavirus, with over 230,000 fatalities registered, the World Health Organization count shows. According to data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Centre, more than 3.4 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed globally since the start of the pandemic in December of last year. The global death toll from the viral disease stands at over 243,500.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple Changes Face ID Feature to Recognize Users With Masks On</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The spread of coronavirus has caused significant changes in how businesses and society as a whole functions, and now Apple is looking to adjust some of its products with the current pandemic. Many spaces like grocery stores and other public spaces have required people to wear a mask at all times. This can easily keep people’s faces from being visible, especially if they are using a feature like the iPhone’s Face ID. Because of that, Apple has created a feature that will take you straight to the lock/passcode screen.
A Twitter user pointed out the feature, saying, “if you’re wearing a mask, iOS 13.5 goes straight to the passcode screen if you try to unlock with Face ID.” Previously, a security firm demonstrated how a mask could present an issue to iPhone X users, noting an iPhone’s Face ID feature could be hacked with a 3D-printed mask that looks like the user. Now, since a 3D-printed mask is no longer needed, the feature could be vulnerable to hackers looking to exploit the face coverings required to be worn in many states. Stay tuned for more updates on this situation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Huawei Rolls Out World’s Highest 5G Station in Mount Everest Area</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite the ongoing US crackdown on Huawei, in place since May 2019, the Chinese tech giant continues to stay afloat, vowing to find replacements for American technologies in the near future to become independent of them.
Huawei Technologies and the network operator China Mobile have completed the world’s highest 5G base station at an altitude of 6,500 metres in the Mount Everest area, according to a press release from the Chinese tech giant.
The station, along with another two that were earlier installed at an altitude of 5,300 metres and 5,800 metres in the area, provides full 5G coverage of Mount Everest on the north ridge as well as the summit, with online download speed reportedly standing at about 1 gigabit per second.
The world’s highest peak, Mount Everest has an altitude of more than 8,840 metres (29,029 feet).
The remarks were echoed by China Mobile which, in turn, touted the 5G project on Mount Everest as “not only another extreme challenge in a human life exclusion zone”, but also as something that “laid a solid foundation for the later development of 5G smart tourism and 5G communications for scientific research”.
The installation of the world’s highest 5G base station comes as Huawei is still grappling with Washington’s crackdown, which kicked off in May 2019, when the Department of Commerce prohibited internet providers from using the company’s products and US tech companies from selling technologies (hardware and software) to Huawei without obtaining a special license first.
The White House claims that the company is collaborating with the Chinese government to allow the latter to spy on those who use the tech giant's equipment, allegations that have been rejected by both Beijing and Huawei.
The US also began a campaign of discouraging countries from allowing the firm to build national 5G networks using similar claims, despite rejections from the UK, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, and some Canadian telecom providers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amid climbing ban, China’s team at Mt Everest to measure world’s tallest peak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">China has sent a team of scientists and surveyors to Mount Everest to measure the world’s tallest peak amid ongoing ban on climbing because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The new measurement of the mountain could resolve the question whether Mount Everest lost some of its height in the magnitude 8.1 earthquake in 2015 that ravaged Nepal.
The project was made public last week on the same day as telecom giant Huawei and China Mobile, the world’s largest mobile operator, announced that they had installed 5G antennas at the mountain’s advance base camp at a height of 6,500 metres and at the lower base camp, at 5300 metres and at 5800 metres to help the survey.
A China Mobile technician told state media that the new network is fast enough for climbers and scientists to have 4K and VR live streaming on the mountain.
The most-accepted elevation of the mountain, which straddles Nepal and China, is 8848 metres or 20,029 feet confirmed after an Indian expedition in 1955.
Beijing and Kathmandu have differed on whether to include the mountain’s snow-capped peak as part of its altitude with the latter favouring it.
The new expedition is expected to update the state of the mountain, which is
known as Sagarmatha in Nepal and Qomolangma in China and in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).
The official news agency Xinhua said earlier this week that a 53-member team from the ministry of national resources (MNR) is conducting preliminary scientific work since early March and survey work on the mountain is due to begin this month.
“The measurement team, consisting of members from the MNR and the national mountaineering team, has arrived at the base camp of the peak for training on mountain climbing and surveying skills in the high-altitude region, making preparation for the measurement planned in May,” the Xinhua report added.
Besides MNR, the mission is being organised by the foreign ministry, the General Administration of Sport and the TAR government.
Li Guopeng, the MNR team leader, said the Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and homegrown surveying equipment will be applied to the measurement.
The team will use aerial gravity measurement to improve the accuracy, and the three-dimensional technology will provide a visual demonstration of the natural resources of Qomolangma, Li said, adding that the measurement team will climb to the summit to obtain reliable data.
According to Beijing, the mountain is recognised as a symbol of the friendship between Nepal and China.
According to a joint statement signed between the two countries last October after President Xi Jinping’s visit, the two sides will promote cooperation in different fields, including addressing climate change and protecting the environment, and jointly announce the height of Mount Qomolangma and conduct scientific researches.
“Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Chinese surveyors have conducted six rounds of scaled measurement and scientific research on Mount Qomolangma and released the height of the peak twice in 1975 and 2005, which was 8,848.13 meters and 8,844.43 meters respectively.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mount Everest gets 5G signal; base station at an altitude of 6,500 metres becomes operational</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> 
New Delhi (the Statesman/ANN)— Chinese mobile maker Huawei and China Telecom have joined forces to set up the world’s highest 5G base station on the altitude of 6500 metres.
Mountaineers climbing from the northern side of Mount Everest i.e. from the Chinese side, can now enjoy 5G coverage and Livestream videos from the ‘highest peak’ as the world’s highest-altitude base station has started operation in the remote Himalayan region of Tibet, the state media reported on Friday.
Built at an altitude of 6,500 metres, the base station which became operational on Thursday, is located at the advance base camp of Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak, according to state-run telecom giant China Mobile.
Located at the China-Nepal border, Mount Everest has an altitude of more than 8,840 metres, with its north part located in Xigaze prefecture of Tibet Autonomous Region.
As per the reports, the Tibet branch of China Mobile has so far finished building three 5G base stations along with another two that were previously built at altitudes of 5,300 metres and 5,800 metres respectively.
These stations will provide the full coverage of 5G signal of Mount Everest on the north ridge as well as the summit, Xinhua news agency reported.
5G is the fifth generation of wireless communication technologies. In addition to faster speeds, 5G offers greater bandwidth and network capacity, paving the way for a future of driverless cars, more connected devices and high-definition connections for virtual meetings and telemedicine.
The facility will ensure telecommunication for the activities of mountain climbing, scientific research, environmental monitoring and high-definition live streaming, said Zhou Min, general manager of Tibet branch of China Mobile.
The latest base station located at the height of 5,300 metres from the sea level is expected to serve the base camp area. Once 5G is commercially available, tourists, mountaineers and other local residents will be able to use the service in the base camp area.
The base stations located at the 5,800 metres and 6,500 metres are temporary base stations to provide signal coverage over the climbing route to the summit.
After the completion of the elevation survey in 2020, the two base stations are expected to be dismantled, the Xinhua reported.
Meanwhile, Chinese mobile maker Huawei and China Telecom have joined forces to set up the world’s highest 5G base station on the altitude of 6500 metres.
“Together with the launch of the Gigabit optical fibre network at the attitude of 6,500 metres, Huawei enables China Mobile to run its dual Gigabit network on Mount Everest,” the company said in a statement.
At the attitude of 5,300 meters, the 5G download speed exceeded 1.66 Gbps, where the upload speed tops 215 Mbps, it said.
On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the first successful arrival at Mount Everest from the northern slope, and the 45th anniversary of China’s first official accurate measurement and announcement of Mount Everest, the 5G network on Mount Everest will provide communication services for this 2020 Mount Everest re-measurement is of great significance, the statement added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm a privacy expert - and I've downloaded the COVIDSafe app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As a privacy professional, I would normally be among the first to join the barricades opposing the new COVIDSafe app, which helps alert people who have come into contact with a COVID-19 case. But we’re in a genuine emergency. And the norms are out the window.
Our government has long tended to put national security ahead of privacy and has a poor track record of technology deployments. Some fear the app could be tracking us and they reject assurances from Canberra that surveillance is not the intent. Critics claim the very idea of the app is unproven and its software not properly tested.
The loudest objection is also the simplest: “I do not trust the government and I will not trust their app.”
All these criticisms are valid. But it saddens me to see respected privacy advocates rehashing entrenched positions at a time like this. There’s very little wrong with the app itself, but people resent it because they resent the government. Yet I don’t see how we can afford that luxury right now.
Do I wish that the COVIDSafe software had been commissioned in a better way? Of course I do. I wish the Department of Home Affairs had not been involved in the tender process and I wish that a certified Australian data centre had been selected to run the database instead of an American business. But given the circumstances, I am willing to climb off my moral high horse.
For all the talk of “lost trust”, the Morrison government has done something big to earn my co-operation: it abandoned its fiscal ideology and without much fanfare went into enormous debt to safeguard Australians’ health and jobs.
Now I am prepared to show comparable pragmatism around privacy and the contact tracing app. I am going to suspend my cynicism and give the Prime Minister a break.
COVIDSafe is pretty innocuous. It works by anonymously logging each time another COVIDSafe user comes into range for a few minutes. The log is kept securely in the smartphone and rolls over every couple of weeks, with old records continually purged. If and when a user tests positive to coronavirus, they can upload the log to their state health department, which will then reach out to the logged contacts and arrange for them to quarantine and get tested.
The app doesn’t track anyone but merely records when pairs of users have come close. By notifying people that they’ve been exposed before they show symptoms, community infection is reduced.
Epidemiologists say COVIDSafe will be a useful addition to their existing disease management. The app won’t dramatically change contact tracing. Critics need to remember that COVID-19 is a notifiable disease and anyone who tests positive is already required by law to undergo an interview process with public health officials and account for their movements.
Frankly, academic reference to “privacy risks” right now makes me a bit sick. Where is the proportionality? With people dying in unfathomable numbers elsewhere, we have a good chance to contain community transmission and save lives with better informed contact tracing.
I am a privileged, relatively wealthy white male who has never really had a privacy problem. No software like COVIDSafe is ever going to harm me. I get how lucky I am and I understand that other sectors of the community have different risk profiles.
By the same token, I admit my privacy advocacy is almost entirely ideological. Like most of my fellow professionals, I have the good fortune of being able to indulge in barbecue-stopping arguments about privacy at a time when tens of thousands are dying in countries just like Australia.
It strikes me as self-indulgent to put one’s privacy principles first when, if we just chilled a little, we might deploy an innocent temporary smartphone app to help our public health system.
So I’ve quit the highfalutin debates, and happily, even optimistically, installed COVIDSafe.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The ACCC is facing a devilishly complex task in forcing Google and Facebook to pay publishers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's new code of conduct designed to bring fairness to the digital advertising marketplace will be world-first. But will it be world-class?
The fight between media companies such as News Corporation and Nine, owner of this newspaper, and Google and Facebook, pits print against digital, regulation against the open internet, market power against political influence, Canberra against California, Walkley Award winning investigations against cat videos.
Our online advertising market is worth about $9 billion a year, and for every $100 spent by advertisers online, excluding classifieds, $47 goes to Google, $24 to Facebook and $29 elsewhere.
But given the intricacies of social media ecosystems, the opacity of digital ad markets, the platform and publishers’ co-dependent but mutually antagonistic embrace, the fact that social media and search engines operate completely different revenue models, attempting to find a way forward will not be easy.
Technically, the purpose of the ACCC code is to correct the "significant imbalance" between the bargaining power of digital platforms and the news media. In internet searches and social media, Google and Facebook are so dominant they are the gateways to the internet, "unavoidable trading partners" for those seeking to do business on the web.
In declaring this the ACCC agrees with the publishers to an extent that has puzzled the web giants. As did the sudden intervention of the government, stung by the closure of local and regional newspapers thanks to the coronavirus advertising collapse. It dumped the voluntary negotiations and demanded a mandatory code. The platforms were blindsided.
The ACCC says there is considerable vital and urgent work to be done. It has to formulate a way to value news content. Good luck. The internet is very good at ranking readership of stories, but if my Big Brother exclusive gets more clicks than your political investigation, it is more valuable, right? And you thought putting a price on carbon was hard.
News Corp is alive to the risks if the publishers don’t adopt a uniform negotiating position and, say, Facebook closes a deal with Guardian Australia, but not News Corp. It wants a provision that bans data collection until all major news publishers have signed up.
The task of designing a mandatory code, with enforcement, penalty and appeal provisions will be very difficult.
Even more difficult: enforcing it.
Litigation at some point appears certain.
Some publishers advocate a licence system, where a designated body collects fees and distributes them to members. But are we ready for a media version of the Australian Wheat Board?
Web giants would prefer a pay-per-click system, used in digital advertising. But publishers would shout blue murder, given platforms use "snippets", preview panes to display content, so readers get the story without leaving the site.
The news industry must fight hard to avoid the experience of musicians, which get a pittance from the platforms. It took the star power of Taylor Swift to win a victory over Apple, which backed down after announcing it would not pay musicians during free the introductory launch of its streaming service.
When Spain forced Google to pay a licence fee for news content, the company shut its local Google News operation down. France is attempting something similar right now.
Let’s be clear. All those who consume the news must pay for it, whether they be digital web giants, or humble newspaper readers.
But the ACCC must ensure its reforms are not just for the big publishers like News and Nine, but also for the 122-year-old Barrier Daily Truth, which stopped publishing two months ago.
It is clear the internet killed print classified revenues just as video killed the radio star. But did those dollars all flow to Facebook and Google or to platforms like Domain and Carsales?
We wish the ACCC luck, but it will be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.

News Corp is alive to the risks if the publishers don’t adopt a uniform negotiating position and, say, Facebook closes a deal with Guardian Australia, but not News Corp. It wants a provision that bans data collection until all major news publishers have signed up.
The task of designing a mandatory code, with enforcement, penalty and appeal provisions will be very difficult.
Even more difficult: enforcing it.
Litigation at some point appears certain.
Some publishers advocate a licence system, where a designated body collects fees and distributes them to members. But are we ready for a media version of the Australian Wheat Board?
Web giants would prefer a pay-per-click system, used in digital advertising. But publishers would shout blue murder, given platforms use "snippets", preview panes to display content, so readers get the story without leaving the site.
The news industry must fight hard to avoid the experience of musicians, which get a pittance from the platforms. It took the star power of Taylor Swift to win a victory over Apple, which backed down after announcing it would not pay musicians during free the introductory launch of its streaming service.
When Spain forced Google to pay a licence fee for news content, the company shut its local Google News operation down. France is attempting something similar right now.
Let’s be clear. All those who consume the news must pay for it, whether they be digital web giants, or humble newspaper readers.
But the ACCC must ensure its reforms are not just for the big publishers like News and Nine, but also for the 122-year-old Barrier Daily Truth, which stopped publishing two months ago.
It is clear the internet killed print classified revenues just as video killed the radio star. But did those dollars all flow to Facebook and Google or to platforms like Domain and Carsales?
We wish the ACCC luck, but it will be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Isle of Wight confirmed as location for NHS coronavirus app trial this week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NHS coronavirus app will enter trials on the Isle of Wight this week.
The contact tracing app - which the government wants ready by mid-May - is part of the crucial “test, track and trace” strategy that is needed before the UK-wide lockdown can be relaxed.
The app, which is voluntary, will use Bluetooth to track when people have come into close contact with someone who, now or later, tests positive for coronavirus.
It will urge someone who’s been in contact with a virus carrier to get tested and to isolate themselves if necessary.
The idea is that this would allow society to partially reopen while keeping the virus at bay and sick people in isolation.
It will be paired with an army of 18,000 human contact tracers to follow up on those who need further attention, or those who don’t download the app.
Officials believe around 60% of the population need to use the app in order for it to be effective.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: “We will be asking the whole country, where possible, to download this mobile phone app”.
The Mirror reported last week that the Isle of Wight was the confirmed location for the app's testing run. Today it was finally confirmed on record by the government.
Mr Shapps said the NHSX tracing app would be trialled on the Isle of Wight this week before being rolled out more widely later this month.
"The idea is that we will encourage as many people to take this up as possible," he told Sky News.
"This is going to be a huge national effort and we need for this to work 50-60% of people to be using this app.
"Not everybody has a smartphone, and I appreciate that for various reasons not everybody will download it but it will be the best possible way to help the NHS."
He stressed the app would be completely confidential.
The Transport Secretary said the app is a "fantastic way" to ensure the country can "keep a lid" on coronavirus and prevent a second wave.
Mr Shapps said he did not know how many of the 18,000 contact tracers the Government is seeking have been hired.
But he insisted it's “not a complicated thing to train for" and people will be in place in time.
Facing claims 18,000 is not nearly enough people, he said the figure was an “initial plan” but ministers think it “might be the right number”.
It comes after Michael Gove suggested island communities could see lockdown restrictions lifted first.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said: "My own personal view is that it is preferable if we do it (lift the lockdown) as one United Kingdom.
"But there is a specific scientific justification for saying that island communities can be areas where you could pilot some measures, contact tracing in particular, in order to combine that with relaxing measures at a progressively greater rate.
"That can help you judge what is right for the country overall."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Contact tracing app to be trialled on Isle of Wight</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A smartphone app to trace the spread of coronavirus will be trialled on the Isle of Wight this week before being rolled out more widely later this month, the Government has announced.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said around 50% to 60% of people will need to use the software for it to be effective as he described it as the “best possible way to help the NHS”.
The NHSX app is part of the Government’s test, track and trace strategy and will be central to its efforts in slowing the spread of coronavirus.
Contact tracing has been used extensively in South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany, where outbreaks have been contained more quickly.
The Government intends to use the app and a phone team to carry out the tracing.
It will be downloaded on to smartphones and use bluetooth technology to work out when other app users are in close enough proximity to potentially spread the virus.
The data is recorded under an anonymous ID, rather than by the person’s name.
If and when someone starts showing symptoms, or tests positive for Covid-19, they are able to share that on the app.
The app then sends a notification warning of possible infection to all those phone users to have come in requisite proximity recently.
Mr Shapps told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “The idea is that we will encourage as many people to take this up as possible.
“This is going to be a huge national effort and we need, for this to work, 50% to 60% of people to be using this app.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 contact tracing app due to be launched by end of May</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE HSE IS aiming to release its contact tracing app to help identify close contacts of a confirmed case of Covid-19 by the end of this month, CEO Paul Reid said today.
The app will only be available on smartphones and will use bluetooth technology to “augment the contact tracing process”, Reid said. 
“It’s not a replacement for the very significant resources we are committing to contact tracing,” he said. 
“The target time for it to come out is the end of May for the launch of it, but it may be a soft launch first to do some prototype testing on it.” 
Ireland’s app will follow the German model in which all information is stored on the device itself rather than a government database.
Any information on contact with a confirmed case is pushed through the app in what Reid described as a “less intrusive system” than the one used by some other countries. 
The HSE’s director of communications Paul Connors previously said on 29 March that the app could be introduced “in the next 10 days or so” on an opt-in basis. 
Countries in Asia were the first to roll out tracing apps, with China launching several that use either direct geolocalisation through phone networks, or data compiled from train and airline travel or road checkpoints.
Their use was systematic and compulsory, and played a key role in allowing Beijing to lift the lockdown and halt contagions.
South Korea issued mass phone alerts announcing locations visited by infected patients, and ordered a tracking app installed on the phone of anyone ordered into isolation – aggressive measures credited with helping curtail the outbreak.
The app being developed in Ireland will fall more in line with other European countries where they are strongly encouraged, but remain voluntary. The apps let relevant authorities see when people’s devices have come into close contact. 
Officials in Europe have called for collaborate efforts to ensure users know when and how their personal data is being used. 
So far, however, most European countries have forged ahead alone on app development.
Paul Reid said Ireland would not simply be copying the app being developed in Germany, instead basing it on “knowledge from the Irish system and Irish social behaviours”.  
He said the app is being developed under a whole-government approach.  
“It is designed to support, giving us better population based information on the disease. It is a Bluetooth functionality and provides that data through Bluetooth,” Reid said.
“We’re currently continuing to work with Google and Apple, to ensure that both applications can provide the support and data that we need.”
Last month, Google and Apple announced a joint initiative that would allow apps to be created allowing both operating system to exchange information with a joint “opt in system” using Bluetooth. 
Data concerns
The Irish app’s project team is developing a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) which will be sent to the Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon. 
“We want to set out in depth in the DPIA how we will mitigate any risks or concerns that may be in relation to data issues,” Paul Reid said. 
Certain places like the UK and Australia are storing the data on their own health systems rather than on the phone itself. 
All information on the Irish app including notifications to people whose device was in close contact with a confirmed case will be pushed out from the app. 
“We want them to contribute a phone number because it makes the contact tracing quicker, but it’s an option to submit a number as well,” Paul Reid from the HSE said. 
“All European regulators have wanted to see less data centrally held in the government systems, and the use of the application itself to push some form of data.”
In the United States, there is no federal tracing plan under consideration, but some states have announced their own, either for bluetooth apps or, in the case of Hawaii, sending out daily questionnaires via text and email to help build a database to track infections.

    <h5 class="mb-1">France to Launch Mass Surveillance COVID-19 App</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the spread of COVID-19 there is a critical situation developing all across the globe. All the countries have announced the lockdown for months and have not allowed any businesses and offices to stay open. Social distancing is the greatest vaccine to fight against the dangerous virus COVID-19.
The governments are monitoring the cases count and helping the patients with proper treatment. Moreover, the government is also taking surveys and asking to quarantine in case any individual comes up with the symptoms of COVID-19.
It has been reported that the French government is being met with strong resistance as it is coming up with a tracing app to deal with the coronavirus. The app is officially called StopCovid. The app would operate to track French citizens and inform them if they come into the contact of people who are infected.
On April 26, around 140 French cybersecurity and privacy experts signed an official public warning about the potential risks of StopCovid and other related apps. Experts state that all the applications involve major risks with regard to respect for individual or privacy freedoms. One of those is mass surveillance by private or public actors, against which the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) itself made a promise the Copenhagen resolutions.
A few French authorities have found themselves locked in a standoff with American tech giant Apple as the app is against iOSs built-in-privacy-protection mechanisms, raising concerns in regard to its privacy.
At present, iPhones operating system does not allow any apps to continuously scan for other devices and send users data out via Bluetooth connection in the background. A smartphone needs to be unlocked and applications must be active on the main screen.
Though, the background functionality is indeed a big part of StopCovid, because it wants to constantly store and send the data to a central server managed by state health services. The French government has asked Apple to remove this privacy-focused approach which is becoming a challenge to run the app.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: An online shopper in Dubai was left stunned when she ordered fake wireless Apple AirPods from Amazon, and received the device which was even bigger that her head in size.
In a Twitter post, the Dubai user by the name of @Al33rzay said that when she opened the package, the fake AirPods left her speechless
"So today I received my airpods from Amazon. God these are huge," she tweeted.
"I got the AirPods from Amazon last month. I knew they were fake because Amazon sells weird stuff, and it wasn't expensive. I was shocked not going to lie, but we move on," she added.
According to a report in New York Post, the lady spent nearly $62 (Dh227.73) for the fake AirPods, which normally retail for more than three times the price.
Her post featureing a photo of the giant AirPods received more than 72,000 retweets.
Most users compared the fake airpods with a hairdryer.
"Most of you saying it's hairdryer. But I say it's 'eardryer,'" she said.
Amazon did not comment on her tweet or the report but the tweet was deleted later, saying it contains "potentially sensitive content".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Woman orders bogus AirPods off Amazon bigger than her head</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Maybe they’re AirPods for an elephant.
An online shopper in Dubai who ordered fake Apple AirPods on Amazon in March was stunned when she opened the package to find that they are bigger than her head.
“I got the AirPods from Amazon last month,” said Aleezay in Twitter post last week. “I knew they were fake because Amazon sells weird stuff, and it wasn’t expensive. I was shocked not going to lie, but we move on.”
She said she spent the equivalent of $62 for the fake AirPods, which normally retail for more than three times the price. Her post, which features a photo of the giant AirPods, received more than 72,000 retweets.
“Most of you saying it’s hairdryer. But I say it’s ‘eardryer,'” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This handy UV gadget disinfects surfaces in seconds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The demand for disinfectant wipes and liquid sanitizers is on the rise—and retailers are struggling to keep up.

Fortunately, there are some great options still in stock that are designed to sanitize nearly any surface, like this portable Mini UV Light Bar that can eliminate germs and disinfect surfaces in just 10 seconds. Simply scan the device over your cellphone, tablet, remote controls, steering wheel—you name it—and enjoy the cleanliness.
One of the best parts about this device is that you can bring it with you anywhere. Not only is the design lightweight, but, since a full charge lasts up to 6 hours, you can take it with you to sanitize elevator buttons and public toilet seats on-the-go.
You can score this Mini UV Light Bar today for just $29.99—that’s 69% off its usual price of $99.95! Considering how much money you will save on Clorox wipes and hand sanitizers, this is a deal you don’t want to miss out on.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Some of Samsung's latest patents show a possible next-gen, triple-camera Galaxy Z Flip</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung is said to have a true Galaxy Fold 2 in the works - now, it also seems there is a 2nd-gen Galaxy Z Flip as well. This clamshell-style foldable, despite its novelty, may be underwhelming in terms of its dual rear cameras. New patents allegedly filed by its maker shows how it might look with 1 lens more.
Samsung released its first-ever clamshell foldable phone in 2020. Considering its specs, it is a good thing it has just such a flexible, Razr-esque screen, as mostother phones with its astronomical price-tag at least deign to have more cameras. The Galaxy Z Flip, on the other hand, makes do with dual rear cameras.
Then again, this may have something to do with the tiny secondary display Samsung has placed right next to this module. Fortunately, it now seems the OEM has worked out how to fit more lenses in while retaining this feature. Evidence of this comes from documents reportedly filed by the World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO).
They apparently demonstrate that Samsung has patented the triple-camera Galaxy Z Flip; moreover, it has done so with these shooters in both portrait and landscape orientations (when looking at the top half of the phone while folded). The latter may be superior in terms of esthetics, as it balances the second display nicely.
On the other hand, the "vertical-cam" Z Flip allows for the same screen to become larger. As this patent may only have been granted at the start of April 2020, the date of this possible next-gen foldable's launch can't be guessed at right now.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's no secret anymore that Samsung is working on a proper successor to the Galaxy Buds+ called Galaxy Buds X. Or they would probably co-exist, but given the rumored price of around $140, we suspect the Buds X will replace the older generation.
Anyway, according to the US Patent Office listing, the Galaxy Buds X will offer active noise cancellation undercutting Apple's AirPods Pro and the Pixel Buds 2. The design also looks a little funky from those leaked renders from a month ago.
Since the pair stopped by the US Patent Office, Samsung is perhaps gearing up for a release sooner than we might think. Stay tuned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus 8 Pro Teardown shows design, repairability score</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The OnePlus 8 Pro Teardown by Zack Nelson, aka JerryRigEverything, has told us the phone features a neatly laid out design. A transparent cover may be best to show off what’s inside and how the company planned the design. The phone is somewhat repairable but IFixit has given it a low score in repairability. No doubt the flagship phone is premium with a premium design, premium specs, and premium features. It may be a waste of money to open the phone but these experts know what they are doing.
The construction of the OnePlus 8 Pro is very much similar to previous models. The sandwich glass design is the same so opening the phone is easy. Remove the rear with some heat and prying.
Opening the back panel is smooth because nothing is blocking the cover. It comes out cleanly as mentioned. We quickly see some insulation that we’re assuming helps in cooling and efficiency in wireless charging.
A golden charging coil greets you as you open the device. The charging coil and the top half of the phone are held by screws. Removing them reveals the motherboard right away. Removing the lower frame quickly follows.
The motherboard is shown but it can’t be removed easily. There are screws that hold it in place. The camera must be removed first before the motherboard is completely removed. Once done, you will notice the residual paste underneath.
The phone is not easily repairable but it shows it can be very durable. The parts seem tight and well-built but it also means the device is not something you can easily destroy. Being the first phone from OnePlus with an official IP rating, it has to be worth its price.

    <h5 class="mb-1">You Should Probably Skip Buying A New Xbox Or PlayStation This Year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now that both Sony and Microsoft have released the official specs of their upcoming consoles, there’s plenty to get excited about this coming holiday season—maybe. In a recent interview with CNBC, Microsoft Xbox chief Phil Spencer said that, while he expects Xbox Series X production to remain on schedule, the covid-19 pandemic may delay games from launching on the new console at the same time of its release.
As of now, Microsoft has only officially committed to launching Halo Infinite alongside the Xbox Series X, according to The Verge. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 is another Microsoft first-party title with a release date of December 2020. So far, there have been no reports of delays, but that is one of the games Spencer was referencing, along with Observer (System Redux), Outriders, and Gods and Monsters, which all currently have Xbox Series X release dates for holiday 2020.
The biggest problem, Spencer said, is that developers are now working remotely. That adds new challenges to the entire game development process, like sharing extremely large files over home internet connections that might not be the fastest. (Thank goodness many ISPs have waived data caps.) If enough games get delayed on either platform, there might not be much of a reason to rush out and buy the latest and greatest consoles. (And maybe wait to upgrade your PC, too.)
A few high-profile games on other consoles were delayed before the pandemic hit. Cyberpunk 2077 was supposed to come out last month, but developer CD Projekt Red delayed that to Sept. 17. Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 was supposed to launch in the first quarter of this year (by the end of March), but creator Hardsuit Labs pushed that back until some later, unannounced date. It’s possible that those companies could have to push the games back further due to the pandemic, but neither have publicly said anything. Neither title is an Xbox Series X nor PlayStation 5 exclusive, though, and CD Projekt Red hasn’t said whether or not Cyberpunk 2077 will be available on the PS5 (though it is definitely coming to the Series X).
Game developer Naughty Dog said last month it was delaying the release of The Last of Us 2 “indefinitely” on the PlayStation. The game was originally set to come out in February, but was then delayed to May. The covid-19 pandemic made the logistics of continuing work on the game difficult. However, after a recent major leak of game content, Naughty Dog set a new release date for June 19. Whether or not it will actually come out on that date remains to be seen.
If it does, that’s one reason to pick up a PlayStation 5 at the end of this year, assuming it comes out according to schedule. If the consoles don’t debut by the end of the year, it will almost definitely result in a massive loss of holiday sales for both companies. But even if both consoles debut on time, and if there’s a decent spread of games available, how many of those titles will actually utilise the consoles’ ray tracing capabilities? We’ve seen what ray tracing looks like with Minecraft on the Xbox Series X, and Square Enix released a demo video of what ray tracing could look like for more graphically intensive games on the Xbox Series X and PS5. But we’ve heard nothing but crickets when it comes to which games will be available with ray tracing on both consoles at launch.
Bloober Team did recently release a sneak peak of all the changes it made to its 2017 game Observer, which includes ray tracing. (There’s a lovely fan-made comparison video here.) If that’s indeed what ray tracing will look like on the Xbox Series X and PS5, then great. But again, will it be ready in time?
It could be a similar situation to Nvidia’s initial release of its RTX graphics cards; there were only one or two games at the time that supported it at launch, but there has been a slow, steady increase in ray tracing-compatible games since then. Cyberpunk 2077 and Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 will both have ray tracing on PC when released, so they should on the new consoles, too.
If Cyberpunk 2077 hits its September release date and is available for the Series X when that console launches, that could be enough of a reason for current Xbox owners to upgrade—at least those who care about ray tracing on console games. (No judgment; I bought the PS4 just because I wanted to play Detroit: Become Human, and there was nothing all that special about that console.) That leaves the PS5 out in the cold graphics-wise since we haven’t seen any sneak peaks or even confirmation about ray tracing games for the upcoming console. But its SSD storage upgrades, a custom 825GB SSD running on a PCIe 4.0 interconnect, and the ability to use off-the-shelf SSDs to expand storage space, will definitely come in handy for The Last of Us 2, which takes up a massive 100GB.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Xbox Series X will arrive on schedule but some games may be delayed -</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft will release its latest gaming console, Xbox Series X, towards the end of the year. As of now, most of the features of this console (especially hardware) are official. However, there are still a couple of things that we do not know about this console. The coronavirus pandemic has affected the schedule of many technology products. Will Microsoft’s latest Xbox Series X game console be affected by this? Xbox head Phil Spencer said in an interview with CNBC that the Xbox Series X console should be delivered on time. 
“Overall, I think we will meet our expectations.” Spencer said in an interview, “I want to say that what we don’t know probably relates to game production. After all, game production is a big project that requires hundreds of thousands of people. Thus, it is more likely that some games may delay”
At present, “Halo: Infinite” is still the only known game to land on Xbox Series X later this year. However, there are reports that Xbox will soon demonstrate a series of new games on the Xbox Series X platform.
As of now, there is no authentic information regarding the price of this console. However, the company says its price will be competitive and flexible.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Unannounced Third-Party Xbox Series X Games to Be Shown Next Week, Insider Says; Microsoft’s Summer ‘E3’ Event Will be a “Big Blowout” for XGS</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unannounced third-party titles will be shown off during Microsoft’s special Inside Xbox episode next week, according to reputable industry insider Shinobi.
Several rumors already hinted at it, and some days ago, Microsoft officially confirmed that it’s planning a special episode of Inside Xbox next week. During the broadcast, Microsoft will be showing off new gameplay of third-party titles running on the Xbox Series X.
Gears Tactics Review – The Perfect Use of Chest-High Walls
As confirmed by Ubisoft, the recently revealed Assassin’s Creed Valhalla will show up, but other than that, we will have to wait and see what the Inside Xbox episode has in store for us. Are we going to see gameplay from yet to be announced third-party games? If reputable insider Shinobi is to be believed, this will indeed be the case.
When asked about it on the ResetEra forums, the insider answered with a clear “yes”. As hinted at by Shinobi, there’s also the possibility that publisher EA will be showing some gameplay for its upcoming titles running on Microsoft’s next-gen console, but this is merely speculation at this point. “I wouldn't say...nothing", Shinobi said when another Resetera user mentioned that EA has no upcoming games for this Fall.
Aside from next week’s third-party showcase, it appears that Microsoft is planning a second digital event that will focus on its first-party titles, and according to Shinobi, this event will be a “big blowout” for Xbox Game Studios.
“I genuinely don't know *everything* that will be there, to be transparent, but I know of several third parties”, he said. “Their 'E3' event is where XGS will get a big blowout.”
As always, we will keep you updated as soon as more info comes in on Microsoft’s Xbox Series X events.
Which third-party titles would you like to see unveiled during next week’s Inside Xbox episode? What about Microsoft’s first-party ‘E3’ event? Hit the comments down below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Design of the new CUBOT phone revealed - Gizchina.com</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today we have for you a little sneak peek at the newest CUBOT model. It should be their first 4G smartphone of 2020 and it’s coming with a pretty big waterdrop screen. After all, big phones are becoming the go-to option these days and are selling the most units. So how does this one look ? Just look at the title picture for a while to get the better idea about the planned NOTE 20.
The edges of the screen are symmetrically curved and of course the phone will have a metal frame. Matte colors are in my opinion also better than the flashy glossy ones and this one should also have a frosted cover for a better on-hand feeling. Back panel of NOTE 20 has a round-shaped camera module with four photo-sensors and LED flash placed next to it. Four camera setup sounds promising so let’s see how it performs.
We don’t know more or less anything about the possible hardware specs of the phone, except the promise of the usual pure-style CUBOT Android system without any bloatware. And of course an extremely affordable price, because that’s their thing for sure. According to out information NOTE 20 should be landing on Aliexpress on June 1st, but more info about it will be released next week.
Oh and in mid-May we will be getting a giveaway event on CUBOT’s official website with 10 pieces of NOTE 20 for free. So should be certainly worth it keeping an eye on that.

    <h5 class="mb-1">These 6 flagship killers are the best alternatives to the OnePlus 8 series</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the OnePlus 8 series, the company has finally hit it out of the park. The hardware is flagship grade and makes next-to-no omissions to reach that pinnacle of performance. The phone has the best display we’ve tested, the cameras finally match up to the competition, and yes, it even has an IP68 rating. 
However, with all the improvements comes a justifiable increase in price. Touching almost $1,000, the OnePlus 8 series is a far cry from the flagship-killing, value-focused hardware OnePlus started off with. So, what are your options if you don’t want to empty out your wallet for a brand new, power-packed piece of kit? 
Here are all the best OnePlus 8 alternatives to satisfy your flagship-killer needs. 
Building its brand on the back of affordable mid-range hardware, Realme finally entered the high-end space with the Realme X2 Pro late last year. Now, the Realme X50 Pro takes on the flagship segment with top-tier hardware and a price that undercuts most of the competition.
The phone employs a tried-and-tested design and bolsters it with excellent build quality. The Snapdragon 865 chipset ensures that performance is as good as it gets, and the included 65W fast charger is one of the fastest solutions around.
We reviewed the phone earlier this year and rated it positively. That said, you might want to temper your expectations from the camera, as the software has a tendency to go overboard with noise reduction and sharpening.
Priced at Rs. 37,999/€599 for the base variant with 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage and going all the way to Rs. 44,999/€749 for the top-end version with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, you can’t doubt the value quotient. If blazing-fast performance is what you crave, the Realme X50 Pro is an excellent OnePlus 8 alternative to consider.
Unlike the OnePlus 8 series, Xiaomi’s Mi 10 makes a play for the premium segment while still trying to be affordable. The phone pairs a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 865 processor with a classy design, excellent stereo speakers, and fast 30W charging.
The star of the show here is the new 108MP primary camera that is paired with a 13MP ultra-wide camera, a 2MP macro camera, as well as a 2MP depth sensor. Elsewhere, you will find a large 4,780mAh battery that not only supports 30W wired charging but also 30W wireless charging, in addition to 10W reverse charging. Compared to the Mi 10 Pro, you do miss out on an optical zoom stack, but the cost savings make up for it.
Despite being a significant step up over the Mi 9, the Mi 10 5G remains an excellent, affordable alternative to 2020 flagships. Indeed, like the OnePlus 8, the Mi 10 Pro is a significant step up as far as specs go, but the phone manages to strike a balance between price, performance that is rather unmatched in today’s smartphone climate. Availability will vary depending on region, but the phone can be had for as little as $599 at Gearbest. 
Looking for performance on a budget? Look no further than the Red Magic 5G. Between the 144Hz display, active cooling, and gaming triggers, the phone is a mobile gamer’s fever dream. It’s the perfect OnePlus 8 alternative for the enthusiast crowd.
The Red Magic 5G gets a lot right. The 144Hz display, for one, is the smoothest available on a smartphone. If your favorite game includes unlocked frame rates, the Red Magic can enable the smoothest gaming experience around. Add to that programmable capacitive triggers, and you’ve got the hardware to truly elevate the experience. 
Further, the Red Magic includes improved haptic feedback similar to HD rumble on consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Once again, your game will need to support the feature, but popular titles like PUBG Mobile already do, so you should be covered. Finally, an active fan keeps everything cool. Yes, I’m not kidding. In addition to the standard liquid cooling solutions, the Red Magic has an honest-to-goodness fan built into it.
For all its features, the Red Magic 5G misses out on smartphone essentials like a good camera. Elsewhere, the default launcher can’t be switched out which is a bit of a bummer. Still, priced at $579/€579/£539 for the 8GB RAM variant with 128GB of storage, it is easy to overlook the shortcomings if the hardware package catches your eye. 
Okay, I know what you are thinking. This isn’t the freshest hardware around. I hear ya. However, the Snapdragon 855 Plus-toting OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro are still some of the top-performing phones around. Both phones are more than capable of maxing out any game you throw at them. And, with OnePlus’ excellent software update record, they should be well supported for the years to come. 
Additionally, there are quite a few features that work out in favor of the older hardware. The camera setup on the OnePlus 7T, for one, is more versatile than the one on the OnePlus 8. The latest model eschews the telephoto lens for a 2MP macro sensor. The OnePlus 7T, on the other hand, gives you a proper 12MP 2x optical zoom lens.
Meanwhile, OnePlus has dropped the motorized selfie camera for a punch-hole camera on the OnePlus 8 Pro. If you, like me, prefer the pop-up solution, the OnePlus 7T Pro remains an excellent OnePlus 8 alternative.
Finally, OnePlus has already dropped prices for the OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro in certain markets, making the phones an even better deal. It might not be the latest hardware around and you miss out on features like wireless charging and an IP rating. However, it’s hard to look past the sheer value on offer.
The OnePlus 7T is priced at just $499 in the US or £549 in the UK. In India, the phone is available for Rs. 34,999 which makes it an incredible deal. The OnePlus 7T Pro is equally affordable and can be had starting at £699 in the UK. The phone got a price drop in India bringing it down as low as Rs. 47,999. 
As Bluetooth headphones get ever more common, smartphone audio has become an afterthought at best. LG, however, has long championed the cause and this continues with the LG G8X. 
The phone not only includes a headphone jack but also a high-quality 32-bit Quad DAC solution that is more than capable of driving even high-end headphones. Coupled with user-adjustable audio presets and DTS:X, the LG G8X is one of the best phones you can buy if audio is a priority.
Elsewhere, the phone delivers serviceable cameras, a last-gen, but still great Snapdragon 855 processor, classic design, and a unique party trick: The LG G8X is the most affordable foldable phone around. Well, kinda.
You can pair up a second-screen accessory with the phone in a form-fitting case. The app support is somewhat limited but what’s there is solid. If you can overlook the large bezels between the two displays, the solution gets pretty close to what the Surface Duo promises. The phone can be had for a mere $699 unlocked over at Amazon, with the dual-screen accessory included!

With the new second-generation iPhone SE, Apple has built the flagship killer that everyone has been clamoring for. There, I said it.
The latest “affordable” iPhone has a laser focus on acquiring the aspirational audience. People who want the best of the best without spending top-dollar. Not only is the iPhone SE significantly more affordable than any other device in our list, it potentially outperforms them too. 
Apple’s optimized approach towards the hardware package is no secret and as such, the company is able to eke out the best possible performance out of the hardware. With the same processor as the latest iPhone 11 Pro, the SE is capable of delivering class-leading performance which makes it a near-perfect OnePlus 8 alternative.
On the imaging front, the iPhone SE ships with a single 12MP camera that does pretty well as long as there is good lighting. Additionally, like most current iPhones, the second-generation iPhone SE also excels at capturing stunning 4K 60FPS video that has extended dynamic range and amazing color science. 
Elsewhere, there’s good and bad. The design is straight out of 2016 and anything but fresh. Massive bezels flank the 4.7-inch display and you will also have to contend with less than exemplary battery life.
It might be a controversial opinion, but for once, Apple has a product that delivers the features people want at a price that is approachable. The absolute best performance, a very good camera, and one of the largest app ecosystems, all for $399 leaves you very little to complain about. 
We think these are your best alternative options in case you aren’t interested in buying a OnePlus 8, but what about you? What are your favorite OnePlus 8 alternatives? Let us know in the comments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best Phones to Use with Mint Mobile in 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Best Phones to Use with Mint Mobile Android Central 2020
Mint Mobile is all about getting great service for a fraction of the price of the big carriers, and for many, that philosophy extends to the phone they choose to use. Thankfully, tons of great Android phones embody the same idea: getting a great experience with the latest specs and features and not paying top dollar for it. The best example of this is the OnePlus 8 Pro, which offers a flagship-like experience for less than the direct competition. It's a great phone to pair with the solid-but-inexpensive Mint Mobile service.
The OnePlus 7 Pro is as excellent and well-designed as any high-end smartphone out today. If you know much about OnePlus, you'll be happy to know it doesn't stray from its traditional formula. Instead, it extends to its logical place in the landscape of 2020 flagships with more features and a higher price — but of course, not too high.
The hardware is toe-to-toe with any flagship, and it's punctuated by the best display OnePlus has ever used. It's bright, colorful, and has a super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate. Inside, there are top-end specs, and that leads to amazing performance thanks to its excellent OxygenOS software — it's just a joy to use.
The 8 Pro also brings the best cameras yet to a OnePlus phone, with a new main camera that steps up to a true flagship level. The entire camera experience is a bit behind the likes of the Galaxy S20+, but then again, it's also less expensive. That's really where the 8 Pro fits. It's a true flagship from top to bottom, but for a bit less money than the traditional players with big brand names.
The best OnePlus has made, but for less
The OnePlus 8 Pro is an impressive and well-designed flagship for hundreds less than the direct competition.
Before the Galaxy S20, the S10 series was a proven winner — and everything Samsung did with this new generation made it easy to recommend the S20+. The S20+ makes improvements across the board, with a bigger and better display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a large 4,500mAh battery, more RAM, and a new Snapdragon 865 processor.
The big move up is with the cameras, with a new array on both sides. The new sensors are larger, which let in more light and take dramatically better low-light photos. It's not quite on the level of the Pixel 4 XL, but this is a step up for Samsung and is no longer a weak point of this flagship. You also get capable zooming at 5-10X while keeping an ultra-wide camera for fun shots.
The only way the S20+ downgrades from the S10+ is in its price and removal of the headphone jack. We're talking about a couple hundred dollar increase from last year, and removing the audio jack is a tough blow for those who rely on it. Both are a result of the way the industry is going — phones keep getting more expensive, and it was one of the last holdouts with a 3.5 mm jack.
Samsung's excellent all-rounder is a winner
The S20+ has a fantastic screen, top-end specs, a strong array of cameras, and feature-packed software. It's expensive but worth it.
Since the Moto G8 isn't being sold directly in the U.S., the new Moto G Power fills the gap by offering a solid Android experience at an amazing price. The phone stands out in the battery department, offering multi-day endurance. Pair it with great software, fun cameras, and solid specs for the money, and the Moto G Power packs quite a punch.
That said, missing NFC and facing Motorola's infamous history with slow or nonexistent software updates could be a reason to think twice before buying one. However, if you want to save money upfront, you just can't beat what you get for this price.
Enough for most people's needs, at an excellent price
The Moto G Power carries on a long history of superb affordable Motorola phones with solid specs and cameras.
The Pixel 4 XL is several months old, but it's still easily the best camera you can get. In daylight, mixed-light, and super-low-light, it consistently beats every other Android — and arguably, the iPhone 11 Pro. While we had issues with its predecessor's performance, the camera app is now fast and fluid. A telephoto lens, paired with clever software, takes good zoom shots at 5X. Its front-facing camera isn't as wide as before, but that's a marginal downside. It still takes crisp, colorful, and bright photos along with great portrait selfies.
The 4 XL, as a complete phone, is, unfortunately, let down by a few shortcomings. Its battery life is the weakest of the flagship competition, it has less RAM (6GB) and storage (64 or 128GB), and its face unlock system hasn't been adopted by many popular apps that need biometric authentication. However, that shouldn't detract from the great things it does — and it is still fully in the conversation of the best phones you can get today.
The best camera you can get in a smartphone today
The Pixel 4 XL has great hardware and the best camera, but it's let down by poor battery life and weak specs for the money.
Samsung typically isn't associated with good inexpensive phones, but starting in 2019 the company started investing heavily in its new Galaxy A line, bringing the best features of its flagships down to a much more reasonable price bracket. The Galaxy A50 is one such beneficiary, with a beautiful 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen, along with an Exynos 9610 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a massive 4000mAh battery.
The best part is that despite its price, it has a capable triple rear camera setup, with a primary 25MP sensor, secondary 8MP ultra-wide camera, and third 5MP sensor for depth information. There's also a huge 25MP camera for selfies, neatly tucked in a display notch.
Samsung's also included an in-display fingerprint sensor, something missing on most other phones in this price range. It's also making a big deal of its One UI software, which replicates the experience you get from its high-end Galaxy S phones.
This is Samsung's best budget phone in years
Samsung finally stepped up its budget game with the A50, a fantastic device that you can pick up for under $300.
OnePlus didn't change a whole lot in the 8 coming from the last-gen 7T, but it didn't need to. You get fresh hardware and design that keeps it in line with the 8 Pro, plus a bump in specs with the same great basics elsewhere. There's a really good 90Hz display, great battery life, solid camera performance, and amazing software.
Keeping its price relatively affordable in the scheme of ever-pricier high-end phones, you had to miss out on a few things. The cameras didn't improve from the 7T, and in some ways downgraded — you lose a telephoto camera and pick up a dedicated macro camera that isn't very useful. Unlike the 8 Pro, you don't get wireless charging, and at the same time, you have to deal with the fact that OnePlus is charging $100 more than it did six months ago for basically the same experience.
Still, if you're looking for a value-focused phone and can't step up to the OnePlus 8 Pro, this is a great phone. Alternatively, if you can find it, consider buying the OnePlus 7T at a deep discount instead.
A less-expensive entry into great OnePlus phones
The OnePlus 8 is a 7T with a few new specs and a larger battery. But even at its higher price, it still represents incredible value.
The Galaxy S20+ and S20 Ultra have paired up to replace the Note 10+ as top-end Samsung phones. But the Note 10+ is still a new device, and it feels modern and capable in just about every way. The hardware is very similar, the internal specs are behind on paper but not in actual real-world use, and they run the same software — and the Note 10+ will still get at least one more big platform update, so it isn't left behind.
The only big downsides compared to the newer phones are in the cameras and display. The cameras have been completely overhauled in the S20 series, with a big step up in main camera quality and low-light capabilities that are way beyond the Note 10+. The displays are basically the same in every way, except for one critical one: they have a 120Hz mode that makes all motion on the screen incredibly smooth and easy on the eyes. It's something you have to experience, and you probably won't want to go back.
On the other hand, nothing can replace the Note 10+'s S Pen. If you love the functionality a stylus brings, the S20+ or S20 Ultra isn't going to get the job done. And because the new models are now available, the Note 10+ is cheaper than it was at launch and a couple of hundred dollars less than even the S20+ — that in itself makes it appealing.
All of Samsung's great features, plus a unique stylus
For many, there's no replacement for a Note. You get great hardware and specs, with a huge display, and the unique S Pen.
ASUS has focused on bringing all of the mobile gaming features you could want in a phone — whether you're playing PUBG, Fortnite, or other intense titles.
The RoG Phone 2 stands out with a unique design that includes secondary charging and headphone ports along the side so they're out of the way when playing games in landscape mode, Air Trigger touch sensors that let you use the corners of your phone as customizable inputs for shooting games, and an external Aero Active Cooler accessory included in the box that keeps the phone cool for long gaming sessions.
The 6.6-inch display features a 120Hz refresh rate for the smoothest possible graphics, and the phone does a great job running games on top settings — even if the ASUS software is a bit busy. And its battery is massive, so you won't be caught dying at an inopportune time. ASUS has refined its vision for the perfect gaming phone, and it delivers. With its polarizing design and huge size, you will need to have a gaming focus to pick this over something more well-rounded, but some people take mobile games seriously and this phone is perfect for that use.
A phone that goes all-in on gaming, and executes well
Excellent performance and lots of gaming-specific features like side ports and heatsinks make this a gamer's dream.
When you're using Mint Mobile, you're likely focused on getting great service for less money, and you want a phone that follows the same philosophy. That phone is the OnePlus 8 Pro, which brings a holistic flagship smartphone experience for less money than the big-name competition. Yes, it's more expensive than previous years, but it also offers much more: water resistance, great cameras, and a top-tier display.
Mint Mobile lets you bring any unlocked phone to its network, so your options are wide open. You can go through this list and find any phone that appeals to you — and your budget — and bring it to Mint without any issue. Whether that's our top pick or something else that meets your needs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Like Windows 10 19H2, Windows 10 20H2 update may just be a minor update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last year Microsoft decided that the second update of 2019 would be a minor update, delivered as a cumulative update, we were told to bring Windows 10 and Azure in sync in terms of development.
This was meant to be a one-off case, with Microsoft expected to continue releasing 2 major updates each year.
According to the latest rumours however, it seems history may be repeating itself, as Windows 10 20H2 may also end up being a minor update.
This is according to Mary Jo Foley from ZDNet, who usually has her ear to the ground. She writes:
As this news is not official yet we can not say what the reasons for the change are, but Microsoft has been working recently to decrease the workload on network administrators, and a minor update to Windows 10 in the second half of the year will reduce the work of both Microsoft developers and also end-users and admins.
Windows 10 20H2 was expected to continue the work of phasing out the old control panel, bring numerous improvements to settings, changes to the file explorer and many other small changes. It is not clear if a switch to a smaller update in the second half of the year will mean these improvements will be delayed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft may have delayed Windows 10 May 2020 Update to fix a zero-day exploit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We've been waiting for Windows 10 May 2020 Update for a while and we thought the final build had been completed -- until Microsoft released an unexpected update build. The company has never specified a date for the release of the final build, but there are suggestions that it has been delayed.
It is said that a zero-day exploit needs to be patched before Windows 10 version 2004 / Windows 10 20H1 / Windows 10 May 2020 Update can be released. The good news is that it should still be released soon enough to warrant including "May" in its name.
See also:
While there is no official word about the delay, Mary Jo Foley says that her sources inform her that a vulnerability needs to be patched before the update can be released to the public, and this is holding things up slightly. A previously unconfirmed release schedule suggested that Windows 10 May 2020 Update would be made generally available on May 12, but now this date is said to have been pushed back by a couple of weeks.
Writing on ZDNet, Foley says:
If this revised schedule is correct, it's now just under four weeks until Windows 10 gets its next feature update.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Windows 10 2004 May 2020 update delayed due to security breach</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like everyone will have to be patient if they want to install the new Windows 10 2004 (May 2020 update) via Windows Update. According to the latest information, the official date has now been postponed to the end of May.
A possible zero-day exploit must first be patched before the new Windows 10 can then be released to the developers and manufacturers. Microsoft’s schedule seems to have a delay by a few days, but a release in May is still in plans.
The original assumption was that the May 2020 update would arrive on May 12. However, there is a new report that there is a postponement to May 28th. The reason is supposed to be a zero-day exploit, which Microsoft wants to fix before release.
OEMs, which should have received the final build on April 28th, will receive it on May 5th if everything goes according to plan. The Windows 10 May 2020 update is again a rather small update, which mainly brings improvements under the hood and does not introduce any major new functions. Nevertheless, it is an important update as it improves Windows 10 performance. In particular, old PCs should benefit from the update the most.
According to the new timelines, Windows 10 version 2004 will now be available to consumers on May 28, 2020. In addition, the update will be available for OEMs on May 5.
If you don’t want to wait, you can download and install May 2020 Update on your PC manually by heading to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Insider and then signing up for the program. But, we recommend for the normal users to wait for the stable update. The current version available for developers could suffer from security issues.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Invasion of privacy': Watchdogs concerned about apps tracking COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER — Privacy watchdogs are voicing concerns over proposals across the country to implement smartphone apps to help track COVID-19.
New Brunswick, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan are among the provinces looking at or planning on creating smartphone apps that would track a user's whereabouts.
Alberta is the first province to launch an app.
Known as contact tracing, the apps track those who the user comes in to contact with, commonly by monitoring a device's Bluetooth signal.
The use of the technology, and the information the apps gather, has become a subject of debate in Canada.
"When we develop these sorts of tools or applications, we're entering into a totally new class or form of surveillance," said Christopher Parsons, a senior research associate at Citizen Lab, part of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Policy. "We’ve never had that level of surveillance in this country."
Parsons, whose research focuses on data privacy and security, said governments may have good intentions but they need to be prepared for the long-term implications of collecting such data.
"If the government doesn't communicate what government organizations can or can't collect with any kind of tracing application, it will almost certainly disenfranchise individuals," he said.
The reaction at various government levels to creating and implementing the apps has been mixed.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government has received a number of proposals but understands that Canadians value their privacy and need certain assurances.
Alberta launched its app, called ABTraceTogether, on Friday. It uses Bluetooth signals to track users and if you're diagnosed with COVID-19, it will contact those you may have come into contact with.
The province said no identifiable information is exchanged between the app users and geolocation data will not be collected.
A spokesman for New Brunswick's Ministry of Health said its app would allow those diagnosed with COVID-19 to send an anonymous message to those they have come in contact with.
Other provinces are taking a wait-and-see approach.
British Columbia is not looking at contact tracing apps at this time, while a spokesperson for Ontario's Health Ministry said no decision has been made.
Only Quebec has strongly pushed back against using contact tracing technology and apps.
"Geolocation cannot replace the contact tracing actions carried out by the public-health departments. In addition, it must not at any time make it possible to identify an individual, in particular, a person suffering from COVID-19," the Quebec Health Ministry said in a statement.
The discussion prompted Canada's privacy commissioner to release a framework for governments. It says collected data should be destroyed when the pandemic ends and that measures must be science-based and "necessary to achieve a specific identified purpose."
"During a crisis, laws can be applied flexibly and contextually, but they must still apply. Our framework aims to focus on what we believe are the most relevant principles in context, without abandoning others," said commissioner Daniel Therrien.
Dr. Peter Phillips, an infectious disease expert at the University of British Columbia, said privacy rights aren't the only issue and Canadians need to make sacrifices based on the benefit for public health.
"Rather than just assuming this is an unacceptable intrusion on people's privacy, there are potentially substantial benefits to be had by having public health response use technology," he said in an interview.
Phillips agreed that privacy issues must be handled carefully.
"The rights of those people who are not yet infected with COVID need to be taken into account as well, because if we don't do everything that we can to contain this by way of public health, then people are going to get sick and some of them will die."
Other countries using such apps are promising to keep a close eye on how the data is used and shared.
Australia launched COVIDSafe and has promised to take only minimal data from its users. Italy has decreed that the information its app collects will remain anonymous and be destroyed by the end of the year.
The rise in popularity of the apps even prompted a joint effort from Google and Apple to allow programming interfaces to work together to share data. Those with Android or Apple smartphone products will both be able to better share data to allow developers to create tracing apps.
The plan, the companies said, is to launch Bluetooth tracing software in the coming months.
In Canada, there are concerns about oversight and guidelines on how the information will be shared.
"It really is an extraordinary invasion of privacy for a democratic state to request," said Brenda McPhail, the director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s privacy, technology and surveillance project.
She said there would need to be an equally extraordinary level of oversight.
Geoffrey Rotstein, CEO of Toronto company EQ Works, said he's aware of the concerns.
His company is developing an app that would track a smartphone's Bluetooth technology but would keep a user's data stored on their phone, not a server.
"We believe we could develop something that becomes a very proactive notification tool," he said. "So, we can proactively identify people in places at risk and help protect people's lives and help get life back to normal faster."
Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said this week that in addition to privacy concerns, the technology itself remains unproven and will need to be refined to ensure false positives and other issues do not emerge.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How the Apple-Google exposure notification system plans to keep users anonymous</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On April 10, Apple and Google announced a coronavirus exposure notification system that will be built into their smartphone operating systems, iOS and Android. The system uses the ubiquitous Bluetooth short-range wireless communication technology.
There are dozens of apps being developed around the world that alert people if they’ve been exposed to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. Many of them also report the identities of the exposed people to public health authorities, which has raised privacy concerns. Several other exposure notification projects, including PACT, BlueTrace and the Covid Watch project, take a similar privacy-protecting approach to Apple’s and Google’s initiative.
So how will the Apple-Google exposure notification system work? As researcherswho study security and privacy of wireless communication, we have examined the companies’ plan and have assessed its effectiveness and privacy implications.
Recently, a study found that contact tracing can be effective in containing diseases such as COVID-19, if large parts of the population participate. Exposure notification schemes like the Apple-Google system aren’t true contact tracing systems because they don’t allow public health authorities to identify people who have been exposed to infected individuals. But digital exposure notification systems have a big advantage: They can be used by millions of people and rapidly warn those who have been exposed to quarantine themselves.
Bluetooth beacons
Because Bluetooth is supported on billions of devices, it seems like an obvious choice of technology for these systems. The protocol used for this is Bluetooth Low Energy, or Bluetooth LE for short. This variant is optimized for energy-efficient communication between small devices, which makes it a popular protocol for smartphones and wearables such as smartwatches.
Bluetooth LE communicates in two main ways. Two devices can communicate over the data channel with each other, such as a smartwatch synchronizing with a phone. Devices can also broadcast useful information to nearby devices over the advertising channel. For example, some devices regularly announce their presence to facilitate automatic connection.
To build an exposure notification app using Bluetooth LE, developers could assign everyone a permanent ID and make every phone broadcast it on an advertising channel. Then, they could build an app that receives the IDs so every phone would be able to keep a record of close encounters with other phones. But that would be a clear violation of privacy. Broadcasting any personally identifiable information via Bluetooth LE is a bad idea, because messages can be read by anyone in range.
Anonymous exchanges
To get around this problem, every phone broadcasts a long random number, which is changed frequently. Other devices receive these numbers and store them if they were sent from close proximity. By using long, unique, random numbers, no personal information is sent via Bluetooth LE.
Apple and Google follow this principle in their specification, but add some cryptography. First, every phone generates a unique tracing key that is kept confidentially on the phone. Every day, the tracing key generates a new daily tracing key. Though the tracing key could be used to identify the phone, the daily tracing key can’t be used to figure out the phone’s permanent tracing key. Then, every 10 to 20 minutes, the daily tracing key generates a new rolling proximity identifier, which looks just like a long random number. This is what gets broadcast to other devices via the Bluetooth advertising channel.
When someone tests positive for COVID-19, they can disclose a list of their daily tracing keys, usually from the previous 14 days. Everyone else’s phones use the disclosed keys to recreate the infected person’s rolling proximity identifiers. The phones then compare the COVID-19-positive identifiers with their own records of the identifiers they received from nearby phones. A match reveals a potential exposure to the virus, but it doesn’t identify the patient.
Most of the competing proposals use a similar approach. The principal difference is that Apple’s and Google’s operating system updates reach far more phones automatically than a single app can. Additionally, by proposing a cross-platform standard, Apple and Google allow existing apps to piggyback and use a common, compatible communication approach that could work across many apps.
No plan is perfect
The Apple-Google exposure notification system is very secure, but it’s no guarantee of either accuracy or privacy. The system could produce a large number of false positives because being within Bluetooth range of an infected person doesn’t necessarily mean the virus has been transmitted. And even if an app records only very strong signals as a proxy for close contact, it cannot know whether there was a wall, a window or a floor between the phones.
However unlikely, there are ways governments or hackers could track or identify people using the system. Bluetooth LE devices use an advertising address when broadcasting on an advertising channel. Though these addresses can be randomized to protect the identity of the sender, we demonstrated last year that it is theoretically possible to track devices for extended periods of time if the advertising message and advertising address are not changed in sync. To Apple’s and Google’s credit, they call for these to be changed synchronously.
But even if the advertising address and a coronavirus app’s rolling identifier are changed in sync, it may still be possible to track someone’s phone. If there isn’t a sufficiently large number of other devices nearby that also change their advertising addresses and rolling identifiers in sync – a process known as mixing – someone could still track individual devices. For example, if there is a single phone in a room, someone could keep track of it because it’s the only phone that could be broadcasting the random identifiers.
Another potential attack involves logging additional information along with the rolling identifiers. Even though the protocol does not send personal information or location data, receiving apps could record when and where they received keys from other phones. If this was done on a large scale – such as an app that systematically collects this extra information – it could be used to identify and track individuals. For example, if a supermarket recorded the exact date and time of incoming rolling proximity identifiers at its checkout lanes and combined that data with credit card swipes, store staff would have a reasonable chance of identifying which customers were COVID-19 positive.
And because Bluetooth LE advertising beacons use plain-text messages, it’s possible to send faked messages. This could be used to troll others by repeating known COVID-19-positive rolling proximity identifiers to many people, resulting in deliberate false positives.
Nevertheless, the Apple-Google system could be the key to alerting thousands of people who have been exposed to the coronavirus while protecting their identities, unlike contact tracing apps that report identifying information to central government or corporate databases. – Rappler.com | The Conversation

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple Watch ECG detects heart condition in German woman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The ECG function of the Apple Watch has been credited with uncovering a heart condition in an 80-year-old woman in Germany, one that was seemingly missed by a hospital's own ECG during a diagnosis.
The Apple Watch has repeatedly appeared in stories where it warned wearers of possible heart problems, and has been praised for being an early warning system for serious cardiovascular issues. In one recently reported case, the Apple wearable actually provided better evidence of a condition than a hospital's own equipment. In a report published in the European Heart Journal on Wednesday and spotted by9to5Mac, an 80-year-old woman attended the University Medical Center Mainz of Johannes Gutenberg University, Germany, with what was described as "typical angina symptoms." The patient also advised of two praesyncopy episodes, a situation where a person almost loses consciousness due to reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the brain. Based on the presented details, and the female engineer's previous diagnosis of arterial hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and having had a pulmonary embolism two years prior, doctors performed an initial 12-channel ECG. The test didn't see any evidence for ischaemia, which is a restriction in blood vessels that can restrict the blood supply. Despite the hospital's own equipment not showing ischaemia, doctors were then convinced there was a related issue by the patient complaining about earlier ectopic beat episodes, which she recorded by using the ECG function of her Apple Watch. The recordings also included tracings with marked ST-segment depression, evidence that led to the medical team omitting further diagnostic measures in favor of treatment.
In effect, the Apple Watch ECG recordings showed evidence of an issue that didn't appear in the hospital's specialized equipment, and successfully convinced doctors to treat the patient. The woman was transferred to a catheterization laboratory for a "left main stem stenosis and a left anterior descending/diagonal bifurcation lesion," and treatment with coronary artery stenting. The patient left the hospital the next day. It is suggested by the report that the Apple Watch "may be used not only to detect atrial fibrillation or atrioventricular-conduction disturbances but also to detect myocardial ischaemia." Current speculation for the Apple Watch Series 6 suggests the next generation of Apple Watch may include a feature for blood oxygen detection, as well as an upgraded ECG capable of working at higher heart rate ranges than the version introduced in the Apple Watch Series 4.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple Watch Detected 80-Year Old’s Heart Condition Which Got Missed by Hospital’s Own ECG</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Apple Watch has been the subject of many stories where it detected an irregularity in the wearer’s heart condition and provided an early warning to prevent any irreparable event from ever occurring. On this occasion, the wearable’s ECG has proven to be more reliable than the hospital’s own equipment, as the smart watch’s feature was able to detect a heart condition in an 80-year old woman in Mainz Germany.
According to a report published in the European Heart Journal on Wednesday, the patient attended the University Medical Center Mainz of Johannes Gutenberg University, Germany, with what was described as ‘typical angina symptoms’. During the session with doctors, the staff performed a 12-channel ECG using their own machine, with the test revealing no evidence for ischemia. Ischemia is a condition in which there is inadequate blood supply to an organ or any other part of the body but more specifically targeted to heart muscles.

Later, the 80-year old patient showed doctors the results of the ECG tests she took with her Apple Watch, revealing ‘tracings with marked ST-segment depression’. In those results, the doctors did see evidence of myocardial ischemia, and the patient was later transferred to the catheterization lab. Further analysis revealed ‘a left main stem stenosis and a left anterior descending/diagonal bifurcation lesion’.
With the evidence shown that was originally ignored by the hospital’s specialized equipment, doctors were convinced to treat the patient. Thanks to this development, the European Heart Journal talks about how far technology has brought about smarter products.

    <h5 class="mb-1">European Heart Journal: Apple Watch ECG detects signs of coronary ischemia missed by hospital ECG</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since the Apple Watch added the ECG app with the Series 4, numerous stories have surfaced about how the app has contributed to saving people’s lives. Now, a new article from the European Heart Journal tells the story of an 80-year-old woman in Mainz Germany whose Apple Watch detected evidence of a heart condition missed by a hospital ECG.
The woman arrived at University Medical Center Mainz complaining of chest pain, irregular heart rhythm, and lightheadedness. At the hospital, doctors performed a traditional 12-channel ECG, which revealed “no evidence for ischemia.”
The patient then showed doctors the results of ECG tests that she took with her Apple Watch, which included “tracings with marked ST-segment depression.” In these results, the doctors did see evidence of myocardial ischemia. The patient was transferred to the catheterization lab which showed “a left main stem stenosis and a left anterior descending/diagonal bifurcation lesion.”
Thus, the patient was treated with “coronary artery stenting” and left the hospital the next day. The Mayo Clinic describes myocardial ischemia as:
The article from the European Health Journal concludes that the Apple Watch can be used to detect myocardial ischemia:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple Watch beats hospital ECG equipment, saves life of an 80-year-old woman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple Watch has once again saved a life and this time it did so by failing ECGs used in hospitals. According to a report from the European Heart Journal, Apple Watch was able to detect a serious health issue in an 80-year old woman with its inbuilt ECG (electrocardiogram) feature, even after she was announced fit. She reportedly complained about light-headedness and chest pain with an irregular pulse.
While the results by Chest Pain Unit of the hospital came normal after the electrocardiogram test, the patient showed Apple Watch ECG recordings that indicated severe coronary ischemia. After going through a heart catheterization, it was revealed that she had “a severe coronary artery disease such as a main stem stenosis and a bifurcation lesion.”

She was then successfully treated with Balloon angioplasty and use of stent.
Praising the Apple Watch, the cardiologists said “The development of smart technologies paves the way for new diagnostic possibilities. In the case of the Apple Watch, after the mobile application is installed, the records an ECG when a finger is placed on the watch’s digital crown. A 30-s tracing is stored in a PDF file that can be retrieved from the application. Thus, the Apple Watch may be used not only to detect atrial fibrillation or atrioventricular-conduction disturbances but also to detect myocardial ischemia. An apple a day may keep myocardial infarction away.”
While ECG is saving lives around the world, there’s another feature that is said to come in Apple Watch Series 6 later this year – Pulse Oximeter. This measures the oxygen saturation level of a patient and may help detect lung-related issues.

    <h5 class="mb-1">An Apple Watch is credited with saving yet another user from an acute heart condition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to a report published in a medical journal, a patient's Apple Watch successfully detected a serious anomaly missed by diagnostic hospital equipment. However, when the individual pointed out ECGs matching the health issue in question generated by her wearable to doctors, it was apparent treatment was in order.
The Apple Watch and its built-in heart-rate monitor has already reportedly detected a potentially fatal cardiovascular incident in 1 case; now, it seems the same wearable has done it again. A recent European Heart Journal report describes an incident in which an 80-year-old woman presented to a medical center in Mainz, Germany with chest pains.
However, her standard ECG and lab tests detected nothing out of the ordinary, and that may have been the end of the case - had the patient not had her Apple Watch and its own ECG records on her.
The patient (who had had a working life in engineering) highlighted these recordings and the fact that they exhibited a specific pattern of changes whenever she was having the pains she had come into the center with. These signs, as it turned out, were "marked ST-segment depressions" commonly associated with the condition of coronary artery ischemia.
Therefore, the patient was sent for a procedure to scan this vital artery in more detail on the strength of these readings. It resulted in a clear image of stenosis (or narrowing) in the left main stem of the vessel, with an additional obstruction in another part of it leading off from there.
These potentially dangerous anomalies were promptly treated with a coronary stent, and the patient was able to leave the center the next day. This case, then, may be yet another point in favor of wearables in real-world, clinical-grade diagnosis. Some analysts believe that this prospect is yet to become apparent; however, it sometimes seems that vision of the future is already here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why smartphones are digital truth serum</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers from University of Pennsylvania published a new paper in the Journal of Marketing that explains that the device people use to communicate can affect the extent to which they are willing to disclose intimate or personal information about themselves.
The study forthcoming in the Journal of Marketing is titled "Full Disclosure: How Smartphones Enhance Consumer Self-disclosure" and is authored by Shiri Melumad and Robert Meyer.
Do smartphones alter what people are willing to disclose about themselves to others? A new study in the Journal of Marketing suggests that they might. The research indicates that people are more willing to reveal personal information about themselves online using their smartphones compared to desktop computers. For example, Tweets and reviews composed on smartphones are more likely to be written from the perspective of the first person, to disclose negative emotions, and to discuss the writer's private family and personal friends. Likewise, when consumers receive an online ad that requests personal information (such as phone number and income), they are more likely to provide it when the request is received on their smartphone compared to their desktop or laptop computer.
Why do smartphones have this effect on behavior? Melumad explains that "Writing on one's smartphone often lowers the barriers to revealing certain types of sensitive information for two reasons; one stemming from the unique form characteristics of phones and the second from the emotional associations that consumers tend to hold with their device." First, one of the most distinguishing features of phones is the small size; something that makes viewing and creating content generally more difficult compared with desktop computers. Because of this difficulty, when writing or responding on a smartphone, a person tends to narrowly focus on completing the task and become less cognizant of external factors that would normally inhibit self-disclosure, such as concerns about what others would do with the information. Smartphone users know this effect well—when using their phones in public places, they often fixate so intently on its content that they become oblivious to what is going on around them.
The second reason people tend to be more self-disclosing on their phones lies in the feelings of comfort and familiarity people associate with their phones. Melumad adds, "Because our smartphones are with us all of the time and perform so many vital functions in our lives, they often serve as 'adult pacifiers' that bring feelings of comfort to their owners." The downstream effect of those feelings shows itself when people are more willing to disclose feelings to a close friend compared to a stranger or open up to a therapist in a comfortable rather than uncomfortable setting. As Meyer says, "Similarly, when writing on our phones, we tend to feel that we are in a comfortable 'safe zone.' As a consequence, we are more willing to open up about ourselves."
The data to support these ideas is far-ranging and includes analyses of thousands of social media posts and online reviews, responses to web ads, and controlled laboratory studies. For example, initial evidence comes from analyses of the depth of self-disclosure revealed in 369,161 Tweets and 10,185 restaurant reviews posted on TripAdvisor.com, with some posted on PCs and some on smartphones.? Using both automated natural-language processing tools and human judgements of self-disclosure, the researchers find robust evidence that smartphone-generated content is indeed more self-disclosing. Perhaps even more compelling is evidence from an analysis of 19,962 "call to action" web ads, where consumers are asked to provide private information.
Consistent with the tendency for smartphones to facilitate greater self-disclosure, compliance was systematically higher for ads targeted at smartphones versus PCs.
The findings have clear and significant implications for firms and consumers. One is that if a firm wishes to gain a deeper understanding of the real preferences and needs of consumers, it may obtain better insights by tracking what they say and do on their smartphones than on their desktops. Likewise, because more self-disclosing content is often perceived to be more honest, firms might encourage consumers to post reviews from their personal devices. But therein lies a potential caution for consumers—these findings suggest that the device people use to communicate can affect what they communicate. This should be kept in mind when thinking about the device one is using when interacting with firms and others.

Because of this difficulty, when writing or responding on a smartphone, a person tends to narrowly focus on completing the task and become less cognizant of external factors that would normally inhibit self-disclosure, such as concerns about what others would do with the information.?Smartphone users know this effect well--when using their phones in public places, they often fixate so intently on its content that they become oblivious to what is going on around them.
The second reason people tend to be more self-disclosing on their phones lies in the feelings of comfort and familiarity people associate with their phones. Melumad adds, "Because our smartphones are with us all of the time and perform so many vital functions in our lives, they often serve as 'adult pacifiers' that bring feelings of comfort to their owners." The downstream effect of those feelings shows itself when people are more willing to disclose feelings to a close friend compared to a stranger or open up to a therapist in a comfortable rather than uncomfortable setting. As Meyer says, "Similarly, when writing on our phones, we tend to feel that we are in a comfortable 'safe zone.' As a consequence, we are more willing to open up about ourselves."
The data to support these ideas is far-ranging and includes analyses of thousands of social media posts and online reviews, responses to web ads, and controlled laboratory studies.?For example, initial evidence comes from analyses of the depth of self-disclosure?revealed in 369,161 Tweets and 10,185 restaurant reviews posted on TripAdvisor.com, with some posted on PCs and some on smartphones.?

Consistent with the tendency for smartphones to facilitate greater self-disclosure, compliance was systematically higher for ads targeted at smartphones versus PCs.
The findings have clear and significant implications for firms and consumers.?One is that if a firm wishes to gain a deeper understanding of the real preferences and needs of consumers, it may obtain better insights by tracking what they say and do on their smartphones than on their desktops.?Likewise, because more self-disclosing content is often perceived to be more honest, firms might encourage consumers to post reviews from their personal devices.?But therein lies a potential caution for consumers--these findings suggest that the device people use to communicate can affect what they communicate.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why smartphones are digital truth serum</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers from University of Pennsylvania published a new paper in the Journal of Marketing that explains that the device people use to communicate can affect the extent to which they are willing to disclose intimate or personal information about themselves.
The study forthcoming in the Journal of Marketing is titled "Full Disclosure: How Smartphones Enhance Consumer Self-disclosure" and is authored by Shiri Melumad and Robert Meyer.
Do smartphones alter what people are willing to disclose about themselves to others? A new study in the Journal of Marketing suggests that they might. The research indicates that people are more willing to reveal personal information about themselves online using their smartphones compared to desktop computers. For example, Tweets and reviews composed on smartphones are more likely to be written from the perspective of the first person, to disclose negative emotions, and to discuss the writer's private family and personal friends. Likewise, when consumers receive an online ad that requests personal information (such as phone number and income), they are more likely to provide it when the request is received on their smartphone compared to their desktop or laptop computer.
Why do smartphones have this effect on behavior? Melumad explains that "Writing on one's smartphone often lowers the barriers to revealing certain types of sensitive information for two reasons; one stemming from the unique form characteristics of phones and the second from the emotional associations that consumers tend to hold with their device." First, one of the most distinguishing features of phones is the small size; something that makes viewing and creating content generally more difficult compared with desktop computers. Because of this difficulty, when writing or responding on a smartphone, a person tends to narrowly focus on completing the task and become less cognizant of external factors that would normally inhibit self-disclosure, such as concerns about what others would do with the information.?Smartphone users know this effect well — when using their phones in public places, they often fixate so intently on its content that they become oblivious to what is going on around them.
The second reason people tend to be more self-disclosing on their phones lies in the feelings of comfort and familiarity people associate with their phones. Melumad adds, "Because our smartphones are with us all of the time and perform so many vital functions in our lives, they often serve as 'adult pacifiers' that bring feelings of comfort to their owners." The downstream effect of those feelings shows itself when people are more willing to disclose feelings to a close friend compared to a stranger or open up to a therapist in a comfortable rather than uncomfortable setting. As Meyer says, "Similarly, when writing on our phones, we tend to feel that we are in a comfortable 'safe zone.' As a consequence, we are more willing to open up about ourselves."

    <h5 class="mb-1">​Publishers want Facebook, Google to share ad revenues amid COVID-19 declines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA -- Publishers that represent a majority of Canadian newspapers have penned an open letter to the federal government urging immediate action to make digital giants like Facebook and Google share their advertising revenues with Canadian media companies.
The letter, which appeared in an ad published in newspapers across the country Saturday, says the situation is urgent, with media companies suffering huge declines in advertising revenue because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The publishers point to action taken recently in Australia, where the country's treasurer has announced mandatory measures to force digital companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter to pay news media for use of their content.
The measures were to be completed by November, but are now being fast-tracked due to steep declines in advertising dollars caused by COVID-19 -- declines that have forced many newspapers to stop printing.
Bob Cox, publisher of the Winnipeg Free Press and one of the signatories of the letter, says newspaper ad revenues in Canada have fallen by at least 50 per cent, which has made the newspaper industry unviable.
"Newspapers are fighting for their very survival right now," he said.
The wage subsidy that forms part of the Liberals' multi-billion dollar pandemic emergency aid package will help, Cox said, calling the program a "life-saver."
The Liberal government is also rolling out a $30-million COVID-19 awareness advertising campaign, which was also billed as support for the media industry, but Cox noted these measures are short-term fixes.
"We expect that the impact of COVID-19 and the decrease in advertising will continue for some time, at least through 2020 and probably into 2021, so we're going to be facing this decrease in advertising for a long time," he said.
"We need to look at the bigger picture, at the longer-term problems, and this is one of those longer-term problems."
Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said last month the government is moving closer to implementing long-promised tax credits for newspapers to address ongoing revenue challenges in the sector. The most significant of these measures is a tax credit that will allow qualified newspapers to claim up to 25 per cent of the wages or salaries they pay to their journalists or other eligible employees.
The credit, which is not available to broadcasters, will be retroactive to salaries that were paid starting on Jan. 1, 2019.
A panel tasked with assessing whether media organizations qualify for these tax measures will begin informing the first news organizations of their qualification for this program this spring, with payments coming in the summer, said Guilbeault's press secretary Camille Gagne-Raynauld.
"Additionally, we are accelerating the processing of applications to our Aid to Publishers program, and expect funds to flow to successful recipients in June," she added, referencing a program aimed at helping print magazines and non-daily newspapers.
As for the actions taken by Australia and France to set deadlines of July for digital giants to start paying for copyrighted media content, Gagne-Raynauld said the federal government is "closely following what is being done abroad with regards to media support," but did not elaborate further.
Cox says he understands the federal government has been busy rolling out billions of dollars in aid for Canadian workers and employers hit by the pandemic while also dealing with a public health emergency.
But implementing measures to make digital giants share the ad revenue they make from content created by Canadian journalists, which they have been featuring on their platforms, would level the playing field for the media industry in Canada, Cox said.
It would also go a long way to help the media industry weather the long-term impacts the pandemic and resulting economic downturn is having and will continue to have on news companies.
"Newspapers and news media in general have been very, very valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have informed the public, they've fulfilled their role, the public has trusted them to deliver information about this very important issue to them," Cox said.
"We feel it's time to establish a solider business model for them going forward. We want to be around for the next time we're needed."
Facebook, Google and Twitter did not immediately respond for comment.
Facebook announced in March it was spending US$100 million to support the news industry during the COVID-19 crisis, and Google also has a Google News Initiative, with an aim to "work with the news industry to help journalism thrive in the digital age."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Make giants share revenue</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Publishers that represent a majority of Canadian newspapers have penned an open letter to the federal government urging immediate action to make digital giants like Facebook and Google share their advertising revenues with Canadian media companies.
The letter, which appeared in an ad published in newspapers across the country Saturday, says the situation is urgent, with media companies suffering huge declines in advertising revenue because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The publishers point to action taken recently in Australia, where the country's treasurer has announced mandatory measures to force digital companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter to pay news media for use of their content.
The measures were to be completed by November, but are now being fast-tracked due to steep declines in advertising dollars caused by COVID-19 — declines that have forced many newspapers to stop printing.
Bob Cox, publisher of the Winnipeg Free Press and one of the signatories of the letter, says newspaper ad revenues in Canada have fallen by at least 50 per cent, which has made the newspaper industry unviable.
"Newspapers are fighting for their very survival right now," he said.
The wage subsidy that forms part of the Liberals' multi-billion dollar pandemic emergency aid package will help, Cox said, calling the program a "life-saver."
The Liberal government is also rolling out a $30-million COVID-19 awareness advertising campaign, which was also billed as support for the media industry, but Cox noted these measures are short-term fixes.
"We expect that the impact of COVID-19 and the decrease in advertising will continue for some time, at least through 2020 and probably into 2021, so we're going to be facing this decrease in advertising for a long time," he said.
"We need to look at the bigger picture, at the longer-term problems, and this is one of those longer-term problems."
Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said last month the government is moving closer to implementing long-promised tax credits for newspapers to address ongoing revenue challenges in the sector. The most significant of these measures is a tax credit that will allow qualified newspapers to claim up to 25 per cent of the wages or salaries they pay to their journalists or other eligible employees.
The credit, which is not available to broadcasters, will be retroactive to salaries that were paid starting on Jan. 1, 2019.
A panel tasked with assessing whether media organizations qualify for these tax measures will begin informing the first news organizations of their qualification for this program this spring, with payments coming in the summer, said Guilbeault's press secretary Camille Gagne-Raynauld.
"Additionally, we are accelerating the processing of applications to our Aid to Publishers program, and expect funds to flow to successful recipients in June," she added, referencing a program aimed at helping print magazines and non-daily newspapers.
As for the actions taken by Australia and France to set deadlines of July for digital giants to start paying for copyrighted media content, Gagne-Raynauld said the federal government is "closely following what is being done abroad with regards to media support," but did not elaborate further.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More people stayed home in Brazil, Japan and Singapore in April as their novel coronavirus cases surged, while people in the US and Australia returned to parks and jobs as infection rates flattened, data from Google show.
The latest weekly update of aggregated travel patterns Google collected from its users' phones pointed to increased disobedience with lockdown orders in place since March but rising compliance with those issued last month.
The data, posted online https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility by the Alphabet Inc unit late on Thursday, compared daily traffic to retail and recreational venues, parks, train and bus stations, grocery stores and workplaces with a five-week period from January 3 to February 6.
Singapore had apparently controlled the spread of the virus through rigorous contact tracing and surveillance, but the nation-state went into lockdown April 7 after outbreaks in migrant worker dormitories.
Retail and park visits in Singapore fell about 25% in the first weekend of April. They dropped about 70% by April's final weekend. Workplace visits, down just 20% at the beginning of April, sank nearly 70% by last week.
Trends were mixed in Brazil, where the virus began appearing in tony neighborhoods and moved to low-income favelas. Declines in visits to bars, cinemas and similar venues held steady into late April, but workplace and parks visits crept back up.
Though Brazil has some local lockdowns, President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly described such measures as extreme.
Leaders in Japan, which declared a state of emergency on April 7, have urged people to stay at home.
Traffic to sites in Tokyo measured by Google fell by half after the declaration and remained at those levels through last weekend. Tokyo's daily reported new cases have fallen since hitting a peak of 201 on April 17.
US authorities warned against returning to normal too soon, but Google's data showed traffic to workplaces was creeping back up. It was down just 48% from the baseline by last Friday after being down 56% on April 10. Southern and Midwestern states were leading the way in resumption of more typical patterns.
Nationwide travel to retail and recreation sites was down 63% on April 12, but was down just 42% two weeks later.
Epidemiologists had expected fatigue with US lockdowns, with concerns escalating as weather warmed and people protested against shelter-in-place orders. Infection rates have stabilised in some regions, prompting governors over the last week to ease lockdowns.
In Australia, visits to transit, workplaces and entertainment venues plunged 80% in mid-April but rebounded in late April when the rate of new cases slowed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">2021 Toyota Corolla Gets More Aggressive Styling In China</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If the latest set of spy images are anything to go by, China could be seen get its own version of the latest Toyota Corolla with a sharper front-end. The said pictures, which surfaced internet recently, show a new iteration of the popular compact with a more aggressive fascia than that of the current model, which, by the way, is a reflection of that of the North American XSE version.
It’s not sure if the spied Toyota Corolla would be sold as a new variant or as a replacement for the current model but we’re sure things would become clearer very soon. These pictures, which come from the good folks at Autohome, allow us to have a good look at the front and the rear facets of the upcoming sedan and one thing that’s pretty much a given is that it would have a lot more street cred than the current model.
As seen in these images, the front fascia will feature the same sharp headlamps as the international-spec Toyota Corolla but the graphics of the headlights have been modified a bit and now carry a new set of LED DRLs. Also, the Toyota insignia has moved a bit from between the headlamps to the bonnet.
Also, the upper grille now looks a lot sleeker with the clean look without the logo. The revised grill features a black mesh design and gloss black surround. The bumper is now edgier than before and features black air intakes. Also, the front-end has even got a chin spoiler.
In spite of all the cosmetic revisions on the front and rear facets, the specifications will likely remain pretty much the same as what we see on the current model. Also, the sedan will continue to be underpinned by the company’s much publicized TNGA platform.
Engine options will include a 1.2-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine that will churn out a maximum power of 116 hp, and a hybrid powertrain that comprises a 1.8-liter Atkinson cycle naturally-aspirated four-cylinder petrol engine mated to an electric motor.

    <h5 class="mb-1">There's A New Lexus Rumor That Will Haunt BMW</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The future of the naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 from Toyota and Lexus has been confirmed: it will be phased out and a new twin-turbo V6 will take its place. The announcement shouldn't have come as a big surprise, but it's still sad to hear nonetheless. However, before that V8 takes its final bow, Lexus might launch a certain model variant that will surely please brand enthusiasts and could even give the likes of BMW some trouble.
According to Japanese language Carsensor.net, a V8-powered Lexus IS 500 is reportedly in the works specifically for the North American market. A right-hand-drive JDM version is not planned. If true, think of the IS 500 as a last hurrah for not only the V8 but also the current generation Lexus IS sport sedan.
Revealed back in 2013, the third-generation IS last underwent an update for the 2016 model year and instead of being replaced outright, it'll receive yet another significant refresh for 2021. The plan would be to continue with the current IS for another three years until the fourth-gen model arrives. Interestingly, the report claims the new IS won't switch to the brand's rear-wheel-drive architecture or even the RWD platform that will underpin the next Mazda 6, which is being co-developed with Toyota.
Instead, the plan is to turn the Lexus IS into a Tesla Model 3 fighter. If so, it will be the first Lexus model to utilize the new e-TNGA electric vehicle architecture.
Going from a naturally aspirated V8 to an all-electric powertrain would be a major change, but there is some logic here. Lexus also just announced the discontinuation of the GS RWD sedan, which also means the GS F is finished. It's powered by that same V8 and the IS provides Lexus with the opportunity to keep that engine around a little while longer. A Lexus IS 500 could potentially produce a hearty 475 horsepower and 395 lb-ft of torque. Think of it as the Lexus IS F we've been hoping to see return for years.
For the time being, Lexus has not applied for the IS 500 trademark in the US, though that could change at any time. Allowing the IS to fill the void that'll soon be left by the GS F would enable Lexus to stay in the high-powered sports sedan game for the next few years. Again, this is merely a rumor for now but it doesn't sound so far-fetched.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rating: 8.1$28,040 Mrlp

Cars do not age well in the short to medium term. Further to rapidly moving design trends that can make a car look old, there’s also the aspect of advancements in technology that can truly lock something into a particular vintage.
In a traditional sense, as gizmos become more affordable, or ‘paid off’ by other models, they swiftly trickle down to the cheaper members of the household. Given a car’s long life cycle, anywhere from six years onward, entry-level product can sometimes forgo advanced tech for quite some time.
The Hyundai i30 range seems to be holding its own, however. It’s bucking the trend of ageing as a well thought out, all-round package that does exactly what it says on the tin – provide fuss-free, safe motoring at a reasonable cost.
Despite being three years old in Australia, and a lot older in terms of design, it still looks smart. Well proportioned with a neat glasshouse and strong character lines, it’s clear that Hyundai spent time and effort reinvigorating the i30 for its second generation.
With a facelift due in the second half of 2020, the current i30 range will soon be in runout – representing great buying for the savvy punter.
Today, we’re drilling down on what we think is the pick of the bunch – the 2020 Hyundai i30 Elite.
Priced from $28,040 before on-roads, it sits squarely in the middle of the six-variant range. For context, the next-step-up models are the Premium and the N Line pair.
The Premium is the same mechanical package with even more trinkets, which to some will be considered unnecessary. The N Line is a sportier-looking option with a more powerful turbocharged engine. However, it forgoes some specification found on the Elite model.
The middle-tier Elite is a clever trim level that gives you just what you need from a driveline perspective, therefore reducing cost, but throws in plenty of goodies to split it apart from the competitor pack. It represents one of those ‘just right’ packages.
Powering the i30 Elite is Hyundai’s workhorse 2.0-litre naturally aspirated engine, with a modest 120kW of power at 6200rpm and 203Nm of torque available from 4700rpm. It's paired with a regular six-speed torque converter automatic.
Despite being a simple power plant, it delivers acceptable performance for a small car. When flexing, it can become a little thrashy and buzzy, which does result in some vibrations felt in the foot well. Apart from that slight niggle, you don’t find yourself expecting or wanting more from it. Tasks such as merging via on-ramps, overtaking in most regular circumstances, and general off-the-line pep are all well catered for.
Admittedly, it lacks the low to mid-range turbo torque that the Honda Civic VTi-L provides. Nor does it have the sparkle that the Volkswagen Golf’s 1.4-litre engine provides, either. But, do you find yourself asking for it when behind the wheel of the i30 Elite? No.
Which begs another question. Is the $1700 cost increase to the i30 N Line worthwhile, given it comes with less equipment, a more complex driveline and, in turn, an arguably less-smooth experience behind the wheel? Again, I’d suggest not, if you’re just after neat and easy transport.
Opting for the Elite models brings with it some heavy-hitting specification that’s seldom found in the sub-$30K hatchback realm.
Inside, you’ll instantly notice and appreciate the leather trim that's decorated with diamond-shaped perforations. Usually reserved for higher-grade models, it’s a nice touch that not only promotes confidence with regard to keeping things clean, but also lends a hand to lift the cabin’s perceived quality tenfold. It’s a shame the seats are not equipped with lumbar support, however.
Regardless, neither the Civic VTi-L, Golf Comfortline or Mazda 3 G20 Evolve offer such luxury for under $30K.
The cabin, when superficially judged, first comes across a bit dark and a little too plastic. Poking around it quickly reveals some well-thought-out design. The storage pockets around the centre console are deep, meaning a wallet and phone can be stored safely without the chance of toppling.
The steering wheel is thin and smart-looking, with a button layout that makes logical sense and is easy to navigate. Getting comfortable is another simple task in the i30, thanks to an equally simple adjustable armrest lid that gives all elbows a place to call home.
Underneath the centre stack, there’s a decent-sized storage bin that houses a USB port, 12V outlet, as well as a wireless charger. Again, the ergonomics are well thought out, with USB ports offset enough so that the USB cable is not stressed, therefore possibly damaged, when the lid is closed.
It’s also built really well, too. Everything lines up, is generally nice to touch and rattle-free. The second-row features air vents but lacks power outlets of any kind. I felt a touch cramped behind a driver's seat set up comfortably for someone around 6ft (183cm), so the taller drivers will have to readjust their seating position to provide adequate space for those behind.
Boot space kicks off from a satisfactory 395L, expanding through to 1301L with everything out and folded. The Honda Civic VTi-L hatch trumps this with 414L and a full-size spare, too, as per the Hyundai. The Mazda 3 hatch’s woeful 295L gets a mention for the sake of coming last only. Consider the i30's boot fair, but not overly huge.
Nevertheless, things get back on track in the technology space. The 8.0-inch touchscreen features native navigation, DAB+ radio, SUNA traffic updates, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Dual climate control is also standard, as is keyless entry and start. That is the sort of clever box-ticking the team at Hyundai Australia did really well with this variant.
The Elite has that balance of the right usable equipment that adds value. Stepping up to the Premium brings an opening sunroof (that’s optional on the Elite anyway), a premium audio system, electric seats that are also heated and air-cooled, LED headlights, plus a few other trinkets.
What’s the cost increase? A whopping $5000 versus the Elite we’re testing here today, bringing the Premium to $35,740 before on-roads. I honestly believe that those additions the Premium brings, as nice as they are, do not introduce some newfound ability or profound improvement to the already great Elite package.
To some who like the finer things in life, the stereo, sunroof and seats are no-brainers. But to the rational clique, you’re already getting the bulk of the beneficial fruit with the Elite variant you’re reading about here.
You could even go so far as to argue that those who do want to treat themselves have the turbo N Line and N Line Premium to pick from in lieu of the regular, naturally aspirated models.
All of these factors further contribute to why we think the Elite makes the most sense for the majority of customers considering an i30.
Another critical piece of equipment in the i30 Elite is the standard fitment of the Hyundai Smart Sense package. This includes essentials such as blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, driver-fatigue monitor, rear cross-traffic alert, and autonomous emergency braking with pedestrian detection.
If you decide to opt for the aforementioned N Line model instead of the Elite, you’ll be paying more to forgo blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. These systems are not available on the N Line versions, sadly.
Again, as nice as turbocharged oomph can be, some may see more value in pocketing the $1700, getting more safety gear and accepting the lesser performance as well as lower running costs associated with the i30 Elite’s more basic non-turbo engine.
Over the test it consumed 8.5 litres per 100km travelled. That puts it 1.1L over Hyundai’s official claim of 7.4L/100km on the combined cycle, which isn’t too bad of a result.
As with nearly all Hyundai product that comes to Australia, the i30 Elite’s ride and handling have been thoroughly scrutinised and picked apart by its local subsidiary. In this process, a team of engineers and suspension champions tune the car to suit our conditions. They make adjustments to the springs, shock absorbers, bushes and steering calibration, and their hard work is evident here.
It's as comfortable at 50km/h as it is at 110km/h. Bigger bumps and ruts, specifically those with pointy tops or sudden drops-offs, do cause for slight harshness, but it's more of a ‘just letting you know’ sort of interruption. Feedback, in ways.
The ride has the ability to firm up when required, but overall it feels great on the road and never sketchy or untrustworthy. You’ll have no qualms in taking the i30 on a country weekend away, covering ground on those lovely high-speed sweepers with a sense of calmness and surety.
The Hankook Ventus Prime tyres are noisy, however. When combined with coarse road surfaces, they emit a subtle yet noticeable whir throughout the cabin. Wet-weather grip is good, but could be improved with better tyres. I came to the conclusion that most of my criticisms with the handling package were aimed squarely at the round rubber things on each corner of the car.
In summary, good on-road manners, plentiful tech, and plenty of baubles to impress your friends, mean that the i30 Elite is a sure-bet choice if you’re looking for a set of wheels.
To most, the Elite’s basic driveline won’t raise concern or warrant the extra cash outlay for an N Line upgrade. To the same mob, it might be hard to justify a near on 18 per cent cost increase, or $5000, for things such as a fancy stereo or full-LED headlights, amongst others.
Against competitors in the segment, none stand out as much better equipped, much better on the road or much easier to live with. That’s why we recognise the i30 Elite as the smart pick of the bunch, both against its enemies and its frenemies within the same brand house.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It appears that Lenovo’s Surface-like detachable, the Ideapad Duet, will be shipping soon to customers.
The $299 detachable Chromebook looks a lot like the Pixel Slate, but at a fraction of the price, and according to ChromeUnboxed those who pre-ordered it from Bestbuy this week expect to receive it on the 11th May.
The detachable device was launched in January this year and features a MediaTek Helio P60T octa-core and 4 GB of RAM, explaining the rather low price. It also has a 1920×1200 10.1 inch IPS display, 128 GB of storage, and large 7,180 mAh battery.  Unlike many tablets, the keyboard with trackpad is bundled with the device.
The tablet has not formally been released yet, with Bestbuy pulling their pre-order this week, but the Lenovo Ideapad Duet is expected to hit US, Switzerland, Taiwan, Japan and Canada around the same time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Pixel Slate with the Brydge keyboard is the best Chromebook you can buy around $500 right now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google reportedly decided to call it quits on tablets (again) after the Pixel Slate failed to take off, but after several Chrome OS updates and a few price drops, it's a great device. With many popular Chromebooks currently out of stock from everyone buying laptops right now, the Pixel Slate is a better option than ever.
The base model Pixel Slate is currently $442.95 at Amazon. For that low price, you get an 8th-generation Intel Core M3 processor, a 12.3-inch 3000x2000 IPS screen, and 64GB of internal storage. That's comparable to the specifications of the cheapest Pixelbook Go, which costs $649 right now.
However, the Pixel Slate doesn't come with a keyboard in the box, and no one should buy the official keyboard case for $199. Thankfully, Brydge's G-Type keyboard is on sale for just $79.99 from the company's own online store.
The Pixel Slate will continue to receive Chrome OS updates until June 2026, so if you decide to buy, it should last you a long time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 apps around the world</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Millions of people in the UK are to be asked to use a phone app to help stop the spread of coronavirus.
The Government is “optimistic” people will download the app to allow better contact tracing – a key factor in beating Covid-19 and helping the country out of lockdown.
Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said he thought the “vast majority” of people would download the app and “play their part” – but insisted it was just one element of the plan to stop the spread.
The app would use Bluetooth to log each time it comes into close range of other devices also running the app.
If someone develops symptoms of Covid-19, they can use the app to inform the NHS, which will then trigger an anonymous alert to any other app users the infected person came into contact with by analysing the collected logs.
Here, the PA news agency looks at how other countries have been using mobile technology in the fight against Covid-19:
– Australia
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
Australia released COVIDSafe last Sunday evening and more than four million people have started using the app.
Use of the app is voluntary, but the government said 40% of Australians, or 10 million people, need to use it for the program to be a success.
Speaking ahead of the weekend, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said more people downloading the app would speed up the reopening of pubs, adding: “If that isn’t an incentive for Australians to download COVIDSafe on a Friday, I don’t know what is.”
– New Zealand
Across the Tasman Sea and New Zealand is also planning an app to help with contact tracing, but Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it would have to be part of a number of measures.
She told reporters: “We are working on it but I have to say our big focus has been getting our in-person contact tracing right, because we will all still be relying on that.”
– Singapore
Developers of the TraceTogether app estimate around one in five people in the city state have downloaded the app, the first Bluetooth contact tracing app in the world.
Half of the 1.1 million downloads of the app came in the first 24 hours.
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
– India
The Aarogya Setu app uses both GPS location and Bluetooth to track users and has been downloaded 50 million times. It is voluntary for Indian citizens, but the government made it mandatory for all of its employees to download to app and use it last week.
– China
China’s app gives users a colour based on a traffic light system – green for clear, red for a coronavirus contact – and it is reportedly needed to move about as widespread restrictions are lifted.
– South Korea
South Korea sits apart from others on the list as it has not used an app-based solution to trace potential contacts. Instead, authorities have tracked people using a number of sources including mobile device tracking and financial transaction information to alert potential contacts.
– Elsewhere
The Czech Republic has released an app similar to the one from Singapore, while North Macedonia’s StopKorona! app uses Bluetooth. Smittestopp in Norway uses both GPS and Bluetooth, while apps are also in development in Italy, Austria and Germany.

Use of the app is voluntary, but the government said 40% of Australians, or 10 million people, need to use it for the program to be a success.
Speaking ahead of the weekend, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said more people downloading the app would speed up the reopening of pubs, adding: “If that isn’t an incentive for Australians to download COVIDSafe on a Friday, I don’t know what is.”
– New Zealand
Across the Tasman Sea and New Zealand is also planning an app to help with contact tracing, but Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it would have to be part of a number of measures.
She told reporters: “We are working on it but I have to say our big focus has been getting our in-person contact tracing right, because we will all still be relying on that.”
– Singapore
Developers of the TraceTogether app estimate around one in five people in the city state have downloaded the app, the first Bluetooth contact tracing app in the world.
Half of the 1.1 million downloads of the app came in the first 24 hours.
– India
The Aarogya Setu app uses both GPS location and Bluetooth to track users and has been downloaded 50 million times. It is voluntary for Indian citizens, but the government made it mandatory for all of its employees to download to app and use it last week.
– China
China’s app gives users a colour based on a traffic light system – green for clear, red for a coronavirus contact – and it is reportedly needed to move about as widespread restrictions are lifted.
– South Korea
South Korea sits apart from others on the list as it has not used an app-based solution to trace potential contacts. Instead, authorities have tracked people using a number of sources including mobile device tracking and financial transaction information to alert potential contacts.
– Elsewhere
The Czech Republic has released an app similar to the one from Singapore, while North Macedonia’s StopKorona! app uses Bluetooth. Smittestopp in Norway uses both GPS and Bluetooth, while apps are also in development in Italy, Austria and Germany.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Pixel 4a With 6GB RAM and an 8-Core Chipset Spotted in Latest Benchmark</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google is gearing up to launch the much-discussed affordable successor of Pixel 3a, the Pixel 4a this May 22. So far, we have come across many leaks giving an insight into the possible design choices, features, and specifications that the new Pixel phone might sport. Now, before its launch, Geekbench confirmed some of the details including the OS that Google’s Pixel 4a will be hitting the shelves later this year.
According to the Geekbench listing, the device sports the Sunfish codename and will be running on Android 10 right off the bat. The chipset that Geekbench’s database mentioned is a Qualcomm SoC with eight cores and is running a base frequency of 1.80 GHz. You should be reminded that the Pixel 4a is said to be running a Snapdragon 730; a hardware detail that’s been mentioned in a previous leak as well.
Google Pixel 4a Release Date Set for Late May, According to German Retailer
As for the memory, the listing suggests a 6GB of RAM and nothing much on the hardware side. The only detail we have for now is that the device achieved 2529 and 6366 points in single-core and multi-core tests, respectively, which is decent for an Android mid-ranger. So far, these are unofficial details, so we cannot bank on them for the time being. However, speaking about the hardware details that have been known so far, is that it comes with a punch-hole display. In addition, it is expected to have a 5.81-inch screen, along with an FHD+ resolution of 2340 x 1080 pixels.
The camera system is being predicted to offer a 12.3MP solution which will be placed in a rear square-module. As for the front side, it is said to be sporting an 8MP shooter with an F/2.0 aperture. The security is being said to be amped with Google incorporating a Titan M chip. More on the security features, the device will come with a fingerprint scanner at the back panel, but that’s about it.
The rumored price tag for Google Pixel 4a is being tipped to start from $399, which is the base price of the 2020 iPhone SE. Whether or not Google’s upcoming affordable offering turns out to be the better option, we’ll find out in the future, so stay tuned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Early Google Pixel 4a camera review showcases the 2020 mid-range Pixel’s camera performance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Later this month, Google is expected to launch the follow-up to the 2019 mid-range Pixel 3a: the Google Pixel 4a. The smartphone, which is expected to come in only one size, is expected to cost $400 at launch, pitting Google’s 2020 mid-range Pixel against the likes of the Apple iPhone SE and Samsung Galaxy A51. While Pixel smartphones aren’t known for their best-in-class hardware, they are known to excel in their picture-taking capabilities. The Pixel 4a will feature a single camera on the front and rear, much like the iPhone SE but unlike the Galaxy A51, but where the phone is expected to really shine is its use of the Google Camera app. Thanks to an early Pixel 4a camera review, we have a pretty good idea of its camera performance.
Google Pixel 4a Forums
Cuban YouTube channel TecnoLike Plus, which is run by Julio Lusson, shared early camera samples from the Google Pixel 4a exclusively with XDA-Developers. Julio Lusson is the YouTuber who gave us our first detailed real-world look at the Pixel 4a back in March. Over the last few days, he has been taking pictures from his pre-release device. Thanks to these photos, we can share our general thoughts on the Pixel 4a’s camera performance ahead of this month’s launch. However, we should note that Julio’s device is running a pre-release firmware build and hence we expect Google to have tuned the camera processing for the upcoming retail software release. Julio did download the latest version of the Google Camera app, version 7.3.021.300172532, onto his device, but we don’t know what version of the app will be preloaded on retail units.
TecnoLike Plus published the below video on his YouTube channel and the following blog post showcasing camera samples that he took, but the video and article are in Spanish, so keep reading below if you’re interested in the full details on the Pixel 4a’s camera specifications and picture samples!
Earlier leaks confirmed the basic hardware specifications of the Google Pixel 4a, but Julio sent us some screenshots of the “camera” tabs in two different hardware information apps so we can share more details on the camera specifications. According to the “Device Info HW” and “DevCheck” apps, the Pixel 4a has a single rear camera consisting of a 12.2MP Sony IMX363 sensor with an f/1.73 aperture lens and 1.4µm pixel size and a single front-facing camera consisting of an 8MP Sony IMX355 sensor with an f/2.0 aperture lens and 1.14µm pixel size. Notably, the Sony IMX363 is the same primary rear camera sensor found on the Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, and Pixel 4, while the Sony IMX355 is the same primary front-facing camera sensor found on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3a.
The two hardware info apps report that the rear camera lens has a horizontal viewing angle of 65.6° while the front camera lens has a horizontal viewing angle of 72.4°. Next, the apps report that the Pixel 4a’s front camera is fixed-focus and supports EIS but not OIS, while the rear camera supports both OIS and EIS with auto-focus.
The following images are camera samples from the Google Pixel 4a. The photos were captured by Julio Lusson and published here with his permission. Due to our WordPress configuration, the below images have been resized and compressed to improve page load speed. However, at the bottom of this article, we have a link to a Google Photos album where the images have been uploaded in their original quality.
Portrait Mode Samples
Portrait Mode is one of the major features of the Google Camera app on Pixel smartphones. It enables “professional-looking shallow depth-of-field images”, according to Google. When Portrait Mode is enabled, the camera zooms in a bit (1.5x for the rear camera and 1.2x for the front camera) because the narrower field of view encourages users to stand further back, which reduces perspective distortion and leads to better portrait photos. Like most Pixel smartphones, the Pixel 4a can use portrait mode with a single camera.
Outdoor Samples
HDR+ is another major feature in the Google Camera app. The feature takes continuous burst shots with short exposures, and the sharpest images are aligned and combined to produce a single image with higher dynamic range. HDR+ is one of the first major features of the Google Camera app which dates all the way back to the Google Nexus 5 and 6, so it’s no surprise to see that it’s supported on the Google Pixel 4a.
Astrophotography Samples
Astrophotography is a new Google Camera feature introduced with the Pixel 4. The feature allows users to take photos of the starry sky. It expands upon the existing “Night Sight” camera mode which enables handheld long exposure shots. Astrophotography requires the user to enable Night Sight and then leave the phone completely still for several minutes while the phone captures multiple exposures—you’ll almost always need to place the phone on a tripod to use Astrophotography. Google brought Astrophotography to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3a after its debut on the Pixel 4, so its presence on the Pixel 4a should come as no surprise. Of course, Google Camera modders ported the feature to older Pixel smartphones.
Low-Light Samples
Night Sight is one of the best Google Camera features to come from the Pixel 3 launch. Google’s Night Sight mode has kept Pixel phones in the conversation as the best camera phones for low-light shots, right under Huawei’s Mate and P series flagships.
Zoom Samples
The Pixel 4 was Google’s first Pixel device with dual rear cameras. Google chose a telephoto camera for the Pixel 4’s secondary rear camera, allowing the phone to boast improved Portrait Mode shots and crisp ~2X optical zoom and up to 8X digital zoom. Part of what makes zoom shots on the Pixel 4 so great is Google’s new Super Res Zoom algorithm. While the Google Pixel 4a only has a single primary camera, Super Res Zoom helps it take passable zoomed-in shots at up to 8X magnification.
Indoor Samples
Lastly, here are some indoor camera samples from the Google Pixel 4a, two of which are in arguably difficult lighting.

XDA Senior Contributor Idrees Patel also offered the following comments on the above photos:
Here are the full (rumored) specifications of the Google Pixel 4a. The phone will launch later this month at an expected retail price of $400. While the Pixel 4a likely won’t have the best hardware at this price point, it will still most likely be a worthy contender for the best mid-range smartphone in the U.S. thanks to Google’s stellar software and support.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Pixel 4A appears on GeekBench as launch draws near</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google has a thing with codenames. Since the birth of the Pixel brand, the company has often given each model a unique codename. It was confirmed in February this year that the Google Pixel 4A is codenamed Sunfish. A device known as Google Sunfish has appeared o the database of GeekBench. This is believed to be the Pixel 4A.
The device ran on GeekBench V4 and as usual, a few specs are listed. The Pixel 4A will run Android 10 out of the box and the model in question features 6GB of RAM. The device is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm processor with a base frequency of 1.80Gz. The Pixel 4A is said to be powered by a Snapdragon 730 processor and the benchmark score is within the range of other SD 730-powered models like the Redmi K20.
Geekbench didn’t reveal any other details but the Pixel 4A is expected to feature a 5.81-inch OLED display with a punch-hole at the upper-left corner. The display has a full HD+ resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels. A 3,080mAh battery will keep the lights on and the phone supports 18W fast charging.
The Pixel 4a punch-hole houses an 8-megapixel camera while at the rear, it packs a single 12MP sensor and LED flash both housed in a square-shaped module. It has a rear-facing fingerprint reader and a 3.5mm audio jack. The handset is likely to arrive in 64 GB and 128 GB storage sizes and will likely be available in Just Black and Barely Blue colour options. The Pixel 4A’s pricing will reportedly start at $399 and will go on sale from May 22.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Pixel 4a: a new leak confirms the design of the smartphone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google is only a few weeks or days away from the presentation of the Pixel 4a, it will probably be available to end customers around the end of May. Now, we have another leak that shows the CAD renders of the upcoming device.
According to Pigtou, the phone has a 5.83-inch display with a punch hole and it is approximately 144.18mm tall, 69.46mm wide and 8.2mm thick. If you count the camera bump on the back, the thickness goes up to 9.13mm. The camera base itself is 19.4 by 19.4 by 0.93mm.
Recall that the Pixel 4a should be presented in the coming weeks. The smartphone will receive an OLED display and a Snapdragon 730 chip. In addition to 6 GB of RAM and 64/128 GB of ROM. Also, it should have a 3080 mAh battery with support for 15-watt charging. The smartphone will arrive in two colors and a price tag of $400.
It is worth mentioning that Google’s mid-range smartphone, the Pixel 4A has been in rumors for quite a while. The company was expected to launch it in its Google I/O 2020, but it got canceled due to COVID-19. Yesterday, a german website has claimed that the device might be available for sale starting from May 22.
Going into the details, the german website has posted that the sales of the Pixel 4A might start from May 22 in Dusseldorf city, Germany. The website claims some internal documents saying that Vodafone carrier has already listed the device for sale and the sales might begin from the above-mentioned date.
However, there is no mention of the pricing of the device in the post. As of now, there is no word about the launch date from Google. This leak tells us that Google may hold an Online-event before the said date or just unveil the phone like what Apple did with its SE 2020.
Recall that recently, the first camera samples taken by the  Pixel 4a are leaked. It shows that the smartphone will have a great camera as always with this smartphone lineup.

    <h5 class="mb-1">These Coronavirus-Fighting Smart Glasses Can 'See' Your Temperature</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chinese startup Rokid has found a unique and somewhat terrifying market foothold for its AI and augmented-reality tech amid the coronavirus pandemic: smart glasses that clock the temperature of those around you.
The Hangzhou-based company has already sold roughly 1,000 pairs to governments, businesses, and schools, according to a Reuters report. While its products are typically tailored to manufacturing and video game markets, Rokid recently pivoted to creating a better way to streamline screening for covid-19 symptoms in response to the outbreak. In about two weeks, the company developed what it’s calling its T1 glasses, a device that can “see” people’s temperatures up to 3 metres (roughly 10 feet) away.
Here’s how it works: The glasses come equipped with an infrared sensor that measures nearby temperatures with the help of a camera, and communicates that information in real-time to the display. It carries a Qualcomm CPU, 12-megapixel camera, Rokid’s U.S. Director Liang Guan told TechCrunch last month, and can also deploy augmented reality features to record photos and videos hands-free.
Given the prevalence of fixed thermometer checkpoints in industrial parks and public spaces across China amid the outbreak, Rokid Vice President Xiang Wenjie told Reuters that demand for its T1 glasses has been ramping up rapidly.
“Apart from fixed temperature measurement, T1 can provide portable, distant and prompt temperature checking, which would be a great help,” Xiang said.
As of early April, Rokid reported it was also negotiating deals to supply its T1 smart glasses to American hospitals and local governments, per TechCrunch.
In 2018, Rokid completed a round of “billion-dollar” financing, per the company’s website, led by investors Swiss bank Credit Suisse, Singaporean holding company Temasek, and others. The company is currently working on an upgraded model capable of measuring multiple temperature readings at the same time to quickly scan crowded spaces such as malls and airports, Reuters reported.
Chinese authorities have been deploying increasingly Orwelliantechnological measures to track the spread of coronavirus as far back as February, with a few big names in American tech following suit soon afterward. Amazon, for instance, has begun using thermal cameras to quickly scan workers at its warehouse and delivery facilities for fevers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AR COVID-19 Glasses Allow You to "See" the Temperature of Those around You</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new Chinese startup is offering a product in the fight against COVID-19 that is straight out of a science fiction movie, reported Reuters. What might that be? Wearable glasses that measure the temperature of all around you.
The firm called Rokid develops augmented reality products for gaming but has now taken its tech to the street to help in the fight against this global pandemic. The Hangzhou-based company developed the glasses in just two weeks.
Rokid Vice President Xiang Wenjie says demand is booming for the glasses called T1. The firm has already sold roughly 1,000 pairs to governments, industrial parks, and schools.
“Apart from fixed temperature measurement, T1 can provide portable, distant and prompt temperature checking, which would be a great help,” Xiang told Reuters.
The T1 augmented reality glasses can record people’s temperatures up to three meters away. And not only do they help people spot temperatures, but they can also deploy augmented reality features to record photos and videos hands-free.  
How does T1 spot temperatures? It uses an infrared sensor that measures nearby temperatures with the help of a camera and then transfers that information over to the display.
The company has now announced it is improving its T1 glasses in order to take multiple temperatures simultaneously. This will make them ideal for use in crowded spaces such as malls and airports to help with the fight against COVID-19.
“With more new products coming out, especially these glasses, we think we can use them to conduct contactless temperature measurement, they are very efficient when faced with a big crowd of people,” Jin Keli, president of Greentown Property Management, told Reuters.
Rokid announced on its website that it completed a round of “billion-dollar” financing led by investors, Swiss bank Credit Suisse, Singaporean holding company Temasek, and others.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Xiaomi states that Mi Browser is safe and the company isn't collecting data</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to a recent article from Forbes, Xiaomi was collecting a worrying amount of information from its native smartphone browser application – Mi Browser. The report states that the amount of collected user data goes from usage analytics to personally identifiable info. That news broke the web with a number of complaints stating that the company was violating user’s privacy. Now, the Chinese giant published a statement denying the claims outright.
Forbes post states that Xiaomi’s Mi Browser collects information like websites the user visited. It also includes search engine queries and items viewed in the browser’s news feed. To make things worse, the report states that the company has been collecting these sensible data even while users were using the browser in the incognito mode. Incognito mode is there to “promote” a safe untraceable browsing mode, however, apparently, it wasn’t the case with Mi Browser.
While the browser encrypts the user data, it uses Base64 encoding which is easily crackable. The report goes beyond and states that the information was being sent to remote servers in Singapore and Russia. Forbes also states that the other Xiaomi-developed browsers – Mi Browser Pro and Mint Browser, also had the very same “data collecting powers”.
After the buzz, the company replied to these claims denying all the information published by Forbes. The company states that it always had user’s privacy and internet security as one of its top priorities. The company explained its data collection practices in a bid to ensure that it’s not what it looks. Moreover, the company states that users should not believe in “incorrect news” that comes to disgrace its reputation.
As per the company’s post, Xiaomi collects two types of data: Aggregated usage statistics data and user browsing data syncs. The latter includes info like browsing data history that sync when user signs in and when data sync function is turned on. The former includes system info, preferences, user interface feature usage, responsiveness and etc. According to the company, a lot of mainstream browsers are doing the same.
Furthermore, the company states that it’s not collecting browser information or history while it is on the Incognito mode. To make things more believable, the company shared its browser software code as proof. Despite the company’s response, the researchers at Forbes are still unconvinced. To them, the company is still collecting data about the phone, including unique numbers for identifying the specific device and Android version.
For now, we’ll need to wait and see how this case will advance. If you’re feeling unsafe with Mi Browser you can download and install other browsers via Google Play Store. It’s curious to see such reports coming a few days after the reveal of MIUI 12. With the new software, the company promises a new level of security with a bunch of new features and even a new Privacy-focused brand.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Xiaomi accused of sending ‘private’ user data to China; company denies claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Xiaomi has been accused of collecting browsing data from its users, according to a new sensational report by Forbes. When cybersecurity researcher Gabi Cirlig examined the Mi Browser on the Redmi Note 8, he found that the phone was collecting a users’ behavior including websites visited, search queries in Google.
Things get a little tricky, when Cirlig found that the tracking continued even when the phone’s browser was set to private or “incognito” mode. Researchers also found that even searches on the so-called privacy-centric DuckDuckGo web browser were being sent to China. Forbes cited multiple security researchers who said that the company was collecting information on unique numbers identifying a device as well as the version of Android it’s running.
Cybersecurity researcher Andrew Tierney reportedly found that the Mi Browser Pro and the Mint Browser — which have more than 15 million downloads through Google’s Play Store — collected the same data.
In response, Xiaomi said “the research claims are untrue,” that “privacy and security is of top concern,” and that it “strictly follows and is fully compliant with local laws and regulations on user data privacy matters.” Xiaomi agrees to the fact that while it was collecting browsing data, that data was anonymized. Forbes reports that it took cybersecurity researchers a mere few seconds to decode the information, which was encoded by a method called base64.
In a blog post, Xiaomi said the researchers “misunderstood what we communicated regarding our data privacy principles and policy.” It further added, “User’s privacy and internet security is of top priority at Xiaomi.”
Xiaomi is India’s largest smartphone maker, but these new acquisitions could dent the company’s reputation in the country. In the past, Xiaomi’s way of handling user data and privacy has raised eyebrows.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Report: Chinese Smartphone Company Xiaomi Spying on Users' Every Move</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A recent report from cybersecurity researchers claims that Chinese electronics maker Xiaomi is spying on users’ web and phone use using “backdoor” technology built into the company’s smartphones, which run Google’s Android OS.
Forbes reports that a cybersecurity researcher found that much of his behavior was being tracked and data collected on his Xiaomi smartphone, leading him to believe that his device data was being sent to the Chinese electronics manufacturer.
“It’s a backdoor with phone functionality,” quips Gabi Cirlig about his new Xiaomi phone. Cirlig discovered that much of the data on his Redmi Note 8 smartphone was being sent to remote servers hosted by Chinese tech giant Alibaba which were being rented by Xiaomi.
Cirlig found that when he browsed the web on the device’s Xiaomi browser it recorded all of the websites he visited including search engine queries. The device also recorded what folders he opened and which screens he swiped to including the status bar and settings page. All of the data was being sent to remote servers in Singapore and Russia through web domains registered in Beijing.
Another cybersecurity researcher, Andrew Tierney, found that browsers shipped by Xioami on Google Play, Mi Browser Pro, and the Mint Browser, were collecting the same data and have been downloaded more than 15 million times combined according to Google Play statistics.
Xiaomi responded to the claims, stating: “The research claims are untrue,” and “Privacy and security is of top concern,” adding that it “strictly follows and is fully compliant with local laws and regulations on user data privacy matters.”
Forbes showed Xiaomi a video made by Cirlig showing how his Google search for “porn” and a visit to the website PornHub were all sent to remote servers even when Cirlig browser in incognito mode. A Xiaomi spokesperson commented: “This video shows the collection of anonymous browsing data, which is one of the most common solutions adopted by internet companies to improve the overall browser product experience through analyzing non-personally identifiable information.”
Both Cirlig and Tierney stated that Xiaomi’s behavior was more invasive than other browsers. “It’s a lot worse than any of the mainstream browsers I have seen,” Tierney said. “Many of them take analytics, but it’s about usage and crashing. Taking browser behavior, including URLs, without explicit consent and in private browsing mode, is about as bad as it gets.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Assistant can now launch Stadia games on Android and Chrome OS</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Google first launched its Stadia cloud gaming service, they made it available for a handful of Android devices, the Google Chrome browser, and the Chromecast Ultra. While Google has yet to expand support to Android TV devices, they have enabled gameplay on dozens of additional Android smartphones and have greatly expanded the service’s functionality and game catalog. In a minor update to Google Assistant rolling out to some users, it’s now possible to directly launch games that you have purchased.
Over on Reddit, user /u/dericiouswon noticed that they were able to launch the game The Turing Test by searching for “the turing test game” in the Chrome OS search box. The Redditor noticed that this search query opened Google Chrome and directed them to a URL under the “ggp.sandbox.google.com” domain, which appears to be where Google’s internal test server is hosted. Other users noticed that you can type the name of a game followed by “game” to launch a title—for example, entering “The Division 2 game” into Assistant will launch the game on Stadia in a new Chrome tab.
According to 9to5Google, you can also launch Stadia games directly on Android phones with the app installed. The publication notes that on both Android and Chrome OS, you can launch a game that you own by saying “play [insert game]” in Google Assistant.

Launching Stadia games through Google Assistant previously worked with the Chromecast Ultra, but now you can launch titles on all platforms where both Stadia and Google Assistant are supported. These smaller integrations demonstrate one area where Google Stadia is superior to Microsoft xCloud or NVIDIA GeForce NOW, provided you own an Android device or Chromebook. In the future, Google promises that Stadia will get deeper integrations with Assistant, but for now, all you can do with Assistant is launch games.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Knowing how many messaging apps Google has is about as difficult as knowing how many children Boris Johnson has, and like the PM, Google may be about to add another.
9to5google have torn down the Google Stadia app and found numerous references to a native text chat feature being built into the app, both private and group. These include:
The feature would supplement the in-game voice chat feature and Google Stadia’s own voice chat feature already in the app.
Google recently released the free version of Google Stadia to everyone, with two months of free Stadia Pro to try out the service.
With the service still only available to use on a limited selection of devices, Google brought in a customer base of over 225,000 potential players. While not a staggering number, it is larger than the service’s 150,000 install base during the service’s launch window.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stadia users can launch games on Android, Chrome OS with Google Assistant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since the first reveal of Stadia, Google planned to incorporate Assistant into the game streaming service.
Some may remember that in the initial reveal, Google showcased an ambitious goal to have Assistant in Stadia offer up YouTube walkthroughs when players got stuck in a game. While that hasn’t come to pass yet, Stadia does support some more basic Assistant functions.
Namely, Stadia users with an Android phone or Chromebook can use Google Assistant to launch games. For example, Stadia users can use the ‘Okay Google’ command with a smart speaker or display and say “Play Destiny 2 on the living room TV” to launch Destiny 2 with Stadia.
Similar commands will work on Android phones with the Stadia app. For example, the command “Play Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey” will launch the game in the Stadia app.
Finally, these commands will work on Chromebooks as well. For example, Pixelbooks have a dedicated Assistant key for launching the voice assistant. Users can type or speak a command to launch a game. Alternatively, Chromebook owners can use the dedicated ‘Search’ key to quickly lookup a Stadia title and launch it.
Some Redditors noticed that typing a game title and ‘game’ (i.e. Doom Eternal game) into Assistant will launch the Stadia title in a new tab. However, launching a game this way doesn’t take players to the usual Stadia URL, ‘stadia.google.com/player/xxxx.’ Instead, it goes to ‘ggp.sandbox.google.com/player/xxxx’ URL.
Regardless of the URL connected to the Stadia stream, it’s a much easier and faster way to launch a game. Typically, players would have to go to Stadia’s website, browse the game library and select a title to play.
While this is a fairly basic Assistant integration, it does reveal the convenience of building Assistant into nearly every service. I’d love to be able to quickly launch games from my Steam library by speaking/typing a search command into my Windows PC. The Assistant integration also serves as a reminder that Stadia games are just streamed media, which makes it easy to access them like you would a song or movie.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘It was a little Wild West early on’: SpaceX’s president says the rocket company’s failures have prepared it to launch its first NASA astronauts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SpaceX, for the first time in the company’s 18-year history, is poised to rocket humans into space.
But the company wouldn’t have grown enough to be ready for the feat if not for its many failures, Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer, said Friday during a series of NASA press briefings.
“We’ve grown up,” Shotwell told Business Insider. “It was a little Wild West early on, but candidly I think that those beginnings and those roots are critically important to our success.”
The company joined pre-mission briefings to answer questions about Demo-2, SpaceX’s upcoming mission to launch NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley toward the International Space Station (ISS). The flight will be SpaceX’s first with passengers, who will pilot the company’s new Crew Dragon spaceship after launching atop a 23-story Falcon 9 rocket.
Demo-2 is currently planned for May 27 at 4:32 p.m. ET. On Friday, NASA officials said the backup launch day is May 30, and that the astronaut’s stay at the ISS may last for more than six months.
Shotwell joined the first virtual press conference with NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine and top members of the Commercial Crew Program Friday. The roughly $8 billion public-private partnership began in 2010 to eventually replace NASA’s space shuttle fleet, which was retired in July 2011. SpaceX won its first contract through the program in September 2014, though the company has officially worked with NASA since 2006.
“Hopefully, NASA has enjoyed the relationship as much as we have. We’ve learned from them. We’ve obviously been pleased by their financial support, their technical support, wisdom, and knowledge and helping us get to this day,” Shotwell told Ars Technica’s Eric Berger during the briefing.
Shotwell said she joined SpaceX in 2002 as its chief salesperson, and always worked to keep a close relationship with NASA.
“I knew when I joined the team that NASA wanted to build a space transportation system that was reliable enough and low-cost enough for people to be able to go to other planets. That sounded very kind of outer-worldly to me at that time in 2002,” she said. “But I certainly understood that if we were to achieve that, we would certainly do that hand-in-hand with NASA. So I’ve seen this company grow from roughly 10 employees to the thousands that we have now.”
Yet along with that growth, Shotwell added, came a lot of failures, which the company has seen its fair share of primarily during tests but also operational missions.
In 2015, SpaceX’s seventh space-station cargo resupply mission for NASA disintegrated late in its launch. The company also lost a commercial telecommunications satellite to a flawed pressure tank design when a Falcon 9 exploded during a launchpad test in September 2016.
Over the past two years, SpaceX also saw parachute issues and an explosive escape engine test on the ground, problems which both the company and NASA say they’ve resolved and closed.
“Even today, when we’re talking about flying people and flying other precious cargo as well, you have to learn those hard lessons,” Shotwell said. “I think sometimes the aerospace industry shies away from failure in the development phase. It looks bad, politically. It’s tough, and the media certainly makes a lot out of failures.”
But, she added, “the best way to learn is to push your systems to their limit, which includes your people, systems, and your processes, and learn where you’re weak and make things better.”
Kathy Lueders, who manages the Commercial Crew Program for NASA, said such lessons have not only been transferred from SpaceX but also learned in partnership with the company – and through disagreements with it.
“The best way to learn technically is to have a healthy tension and dynamic and be able to have to defend technical positions. And SpaceX makes us defend technical positions, as we make SpaceX technical positions,” Lueders said. “What that does is creates a body of work that I think we, as an agency, have really been able to build and I can tell you are building on [for] our future programs. So I think this has been a great relationship for the both of us over the last 13 years.”
Personally, Shotwell said, she will not rest until Behnken and Hurley safely complete their mission.
“My heart is sitting right here, and I think it’s going to stay there until we get Bob and Doug safely back from the International Space Station,” She said, holding her finger up to her throat. “But between now and then, there’s still work to do. I’ve got thousands of SpaceX employees who are focused on this mission.”
Shotwell described Behnken and Hurley as “badass” test pilots and astronauts, but also dads and people. She noted that SpaceX employees put photos of the crew on electronic work orders for Crew Dragon to keep the stakes of their task front-and-center.
“I will start sleeping again when they when they’re back safely on the planet,” Shotwell told Marcia Dunn of the Associated Press. “I don’t think I need to remind my employees how important this is. They remind themselves, and they are helpful in reminding me.”
Behnken said during another press briefing that SpaceX’s agility has impressed him most about Crew Dragon’s development. He also indicated that the ability to work quickly gives him more confidence going into his historic flight – the first debut of a new human-rated spaceship since 1981.
“Doug and I flew on shuttle missions separated by a couple of years,” Behnken told Business Insider on Friday. “We [didn’t] get, probably, the same level of change that we can get in a month from the SpaceX team during the couple of years that was between our shuttle flights.”
He added: “I hope I don’t have to see it: That agility in response to an issue during our mission. But we’ve seen it during the development process, and I know they could execute it if we needed them to while we are in orbit.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'We've grown up': SpaceX's failures prepared it to launch its first NASA astronauts, says rocket company president Gwynne Shotwell</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SpaceX, for the first time in the company’s 18-year history, is poised to rocket humans into space.
But the company wouldn’t have grown enough to be ready for the feat if not for its many failures, Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer, said Friday during a series of NASA press briefings.
“We’ve grown up,” Shotwell told Business Insider. “It was a little Wild West early on, but candidly I think that those beginnings and those roots are critically important to our success.”
The company joined pre-mission briefings to answer questions about Demo-2, SpaceX’s upcoming mission to launch NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley toward the International Space Station (ISS). The flight will be SpaceX’s first with passengers, who will pilot the company’s new Crew Dragon spaceship after launching atop a 23-story Falcon 9 rocket.
Demo-2 is currently planned for May 27 at 4:32 p.m. ET. On Friday, NASA officials said the backup launch day is May 30, and that the astronaut’s stay at the ISS may last for more than six months.
Shotwell joined the first virtual press conference with NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine and top members of the Commercial Crew Program Friday. The roughly $US8 billion public-private partnership began in 2010 to eventually replace NASA’s space shuttle fleet, which was retired in July 2011. SpaceX won its first contract through the program in September 2014, though the company has officially worked with NASA since 2006.
“Hopefully, NASA has enjoyed the relationship as much as we have. We’ve learned from them. We’ve obviously been pleased by their financial support, their technical support, wisdom, and knowledge and helping us get to this day,” Shotwell told Ars Technica’s Eric Berger during the briefing.
Shotwell said she joined SpaceX in 2002 as its chief salesperson, and always worked to keep a close relationship with NASA.
“I knew when I joined the team that NASA wanted to build a space transportation system that was reliable enough and low-cost enough for people to be able to go to other planets. That sounded very kind of outer-worldly to me at that time in 2002,” she said. “But I certainly understood that if we were to achieve that, we would certainly do that hand-in-hand with NASA. So I’ve seen this company grow from roughly 10 employees to the thousands that we have now.”
Yet along with that growth, Shotwell added, came a lot of failures, which the company has seen its fair share of primarily during tests but also operational missions.
In 2015, SpaceX’s seventh space-station cargo resupply mission for NASA disintegrated late in its launch. The company also lost a commercial telecommunications satellite to a flawed pressure tank design when a Falcon 9 exploded during a launchpad test in September 2016.
Over the past two years, SpaceX also saw parachute issues and an explosive escape engine test on the ground, problems which both the company and NASA say they have resolved and closed.
“Even today, when we’re talking about flying people and flying other precious cargo as well, you have to learn those hard lessons,” Shotwell said. “I think sometimes the aerospace industry shies away from failure in the development phase. It looks bad, politically. It’s tough, and the media certainly makes a lot out of failures.”
But, she added, “the best way to learn is to push your systems to their limit, which includes your people, systems, and your processes, and learn where you’re weak and make things better.”
Kathy Lueders, who manages the Commercial Crew Program for NASA, said such lessons have not only been transferred from SpaceX but also learned in partnership with the company – and through disagreements with it.
“The best way to learn technically is to have a healthy tension and dynamic and be able to have to defend technical positions. And SpaceX makes us defend technical positions, as we make SpaceX technical positions,” Lueders said. “What that does is creates a body of work that I think we, as an agency, have really been able to build and I can tell you are building on [for] our future programs. So I think this has been a great relationship for the both of us over the last 13 years.”
Personally, Shotwell said, she will not rest until Behnken and Hurley safely complete their mission.
“My heart is sitting right here, and I think it’s going to stay there until we get Bob and Doug safely back from the International Space Station,” She said, holding her finger up to her throat. “But between now and then, there’s still work to do. I’ve got thousands of SpaceX employees who are focused on this mission.”
Shotwell described Behnken and Hurley as “badass” test pilots and astronauts, but also dads and people. She noted that SpaceX employees put photos of the crew on electronic work orders for Crew Dragon to keep the stakes of their task front-and-centre.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple Leak Reveals Radical New MacBook Pro</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple may finally be getting round to updating the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Intel’s tenth generation processors. The good news is that the MacOS powered laptop going to get a bucketload of extra power.
The latest details come from popular unlike benchmarking service 3DMark. Picked up by the prolific Apple commentator @_rogame on Twitter, the specs highlight a monster machine:
Intel’s i7-1068NG7 CPU is probably the biggest indication of the power that will be on tap. Not only is it one of Intel’s tenth generation chips (offering far more performance than the current 8th-generation chipset in the 13-inch model from 2019), it’s also a brand new chip that has yet to be confirmed by Intel. Welcome to a MacBook Pro with a cutting edge processor of the current generation.
This laptop is loaded to bear in terms of memory and storage as well. The current 13-inch MacBook Pro can be upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage, so we’re looking at a doubling of the core specs. That suggests this MacBook is going to be able to handle a lot of high end media work,especially 4K video.
On top of the hardware specs here, the new MacBook Pro is expect to follow the MacBook Air and 16-inch MacBook Pro with a new design to increase the thermal efficiency and the replacement of the butterfly keyboard with the scissor-switch based Magic Keyboard. Given the 16-inch MacBook Pro was the replacement for the 15-inch MacBook Pro, many of the geekerati are hoping for the upcoming ‘smaller’ MacBook Pro to shrink the bezels and add a millimeter or two so a 14-inch screen can be used, instead of the current 13-inch screen. 
I’m pretty sure we’re looking at the top-specced MacBook Pro here, and a price that will be in excess of $3000 when it goes on sale. No doubt the entry level machine will sport a lower configuration. My best guess would be a Core i5 chip, 8 GB of memory and a 256 GB SSD, priced at around $1499.
As for the all important release date, before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the obvious time would be to do it during the keynote of the annual Worldwide Developer Conference which traditionally takes place in June. Given WWDC is going virtual, you have to assume that this new MacBook Pro will follow the same route as March’s MacBook Air with online announcements and press releases driving the awareness.

    <h5 class="mb-1">3DMark confirms 28 W processor for next MacBook Pro; up to 32 GB of RAM and a 4 TB SSD too, but no Ryzen 4000 Renoir options</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Expected to drop before WWDC 2020, the next smaller MacBook Pro has been said to be making the switch to 14-inch displays. Apple's new Magic Keyboard also seems a likely upgrade, and now 3DMark has confirmed that Apple will offer up to 32 GB of RAM and a 4 TB SSD. The MacBook Pro 2020 will have a powerful CPU option too, but not one of those Ryzen 4000 Renoir processors.
While WWDC is Apple's next big event of 2020, rumour has it that the company is planning to release a smaller MacBook Pro refresh this month. Codenamed J223, the MacBook Pro is expected to feature Apple's new Magic Keyboard, which the company has already rolled out to the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro 16. 
An upgrade to a 14-inch display has also been touted as a "big possibility". The publication of another benchmark listing has seemingly all but confirmed what processors Apple on which has based its next smaller MacBook Pro, too. Spotted by @_rogame on 3DMark running a Core i7-1068NG7, the upcoming smaller MacBook Pro looks nailed on for an Ice Lake-U series upgrade.
This is not the first time that we have seen a Core i7-1068NG7-powered MacBook Pro on 3DMark either, nor one with 32 GB of RAM. While the latter is an upgrade over the maximum of 16 GB that Apple currently offers with the latest MacBook Pro 13, the presence of a 4 TB SSD this time around is another upgrade too.
Intel is yet to confirm the existence of the Core i7-1068NG7, for clarity. However, the three NG processors that Apple offers with the latest MacBook Air indicate how the processor would compare against the Core i7-1068G7.
Clocked at a base of 2.3 GHz, the Core i7-1068G7 can reach 4.1 GHz on a TDP of 28 W. The CPU includes 8 MB of L3 cache and has an Intel Iris Plus Graphics G7 GPU that can boost up to 1,100 MHz. Incidentally, the Core i7-1068G7 shares the last two details with the Core i7-1065G7.
Based on the NG processors that Apple offers with the latest MacBook Air, the Core i7-1068NG7 would not have a configurable TDP, nor would it support Intel Optane Memory or Trusted Execution Technology. The Core i7-1068NG7 should have a smaller package size than the regular Core i7-1068G7 too.
Undoubtedly, a MacBook Pro equipped with 32 GB of RAM, a 28 W Core i7 processor and a 4 TB SSD would be of Apple's upper-tier models, if not the most expensive one that it offers. Either way, current MacBook Pro suggests that this model would cost well over US$3,000. 
With that said, Apple generally equips its entry-level MacBook Pro 13 with a Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD. If that follows with the 2020 refresh, then we may see the Core i5-1035NG7. Additionally, Apple typically offers two Core i7 processors, which is where the Core i7-1065NG7 would come in.
Those three Ice Lake-U series processors are unlikely to offer the processor performance of Renoir chips. However, they would provide a significant boost over the Whiskey Lake-U series with which Apple equips the current MacBook Pro 13. The same applies to GPU performance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indonesia's Tokopedia probes alleged data leak of 91 million users</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Tokopedia, Indonesia’s largest e-commerce platform, said it was investigating an attempted hack and claims that the details of millions of its users had been leaked online.
“We found that there had been an attempt to steal data from Tokopedia users,” a spokesman for the company said in a statement late Saturday.
“However, Tokopedia ensures that crucial information such as passwords remains successfully protected behind encryption.”
“At this moment, we continue to investigate further into this matter and there is no additional information that we can share,” the statement added.
Data breach monitoring firm Under the Breach published a Twitter post on Saturday showing screenshots from an unnamed individual who claimed he had acquired the personal details of 15 million Tokopedia users during a March 2020 hack on the e-commerce site.
According to the screenshots, which show names, emails and birthdays, the hacker alleges he or she is in possession of a much bigger user database and asks for assistance to “crack” users’ passwords.
Under the Breach, which monitors cyber crime, said on Sunday the hacker had updated the post to offer the details of 91 million users for “$5,000 on the Darknet”. The firm shared a screenshot of the hacker’s proposed offer posted online.
Backed by $2 billion in funding from investors including SoftBank Group Corp’s Vision Fund and Alibaba, Tokopedia, whose founder and CEO William Tanuwijaya is one of the country’s most prominent tech entrepreneurs, claims more than 90 million monthly active users.
A Tokopedia spokesman declined to comment directly on the hacker’s claims, but told Reuters on Sunday that “all transactions with all payments methods at Tokopedia ... remain secure.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Remote work doesn't get much more remote than piloting a robot 140 million miles away on the surface of Mars.
NASA, alongside many other workplaces, has had to shut its doors during the coronavirus pandemic. For engineers and scientists working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) responsible for driving the Curiosity Mars rover, this meant setting up systems so they could continue to communicate with the rover while all stuck in their homes.
Business Insider spoke to two NASA employees currently on the rover team about how they are managing to execute commands and even make scientific advances while working from home.
Alicia Allbaugh has worked on and off at NASA since 1991, and oversees the 75-person rover program which she has worked on since 2006. When she heard rumblings about the pandemic and potential lockdowns on NPR, she started to form a plan for if the rover team suddenly had to ship out. The rover team has had to think about some work-from-home plans in the past in case of earthquakes, Allbaugh said.
Luckily for the rover team, there was already some infrastructure in place because it works with scientists all over the world, so a degree of teleconferencing functionality was already on hand. They were able to do an experimental test run on March 12, five days before NASA shut its offices.
It took everyone a few hours to acclimatize to setting up all their windows and chats so they fit onto home monitor screens. "We figured it out within like two, three hours. We were sort of getting into the groove and understanding the ebb and flow and the pace," she said. The test went off surprisingly well, with the rover receiving and successfully executing a set of orders.
Before NASA issued the order sending its employees home on March 17, Allbaugh had also gone into the office and done an inventory of all the spare monitors and headsets the team had on hand and what they would have to order in. When news did come that employees shouldn't come back to work the next day, her team grabbed what they needed and headed home.
The Curiosity rover is equipped with 3D cameras, which it uses to send 3D images back to its drivers to help work out where it should go next. Ordinarily the team look at these images with special high-tech 3D goggles which flip which eye is looking at the image at a rate of about 60 times per second.
"The reason we have them, in general, is because the Rover drivers need to visualize how the Rover moves over 3D train," said Matt Gildner, the rover planner team lead.
Gildner oversees a team of about 20 planners who write and send commands telling the rover where to go. He added that the 3D images give the drivers a better idea of how steep a slope might be, or how sandy the ground might be.
But the goggles require heavy-duty graphics cards normally used in gaming computers, and it wasn't going to be practical to get these working at home, so NASA found a less high-tech solution.
Rover planners are now using simple plastic red-blue glasses, the same kind you would use to watch a 3D movie. Gildner says he pops the glasses on for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time about three times a day to look around at where the rover is.
"It really helps us do our jobs. I mean, we couldn't do it without it," he said.
The various groups that work on Curiosity are used to being in large rooms where they can easily talk to each other and convene amongst themselves, and simulating this kind of communication was a big challenge for the team.
Broadly speaking the work is split into uplink (what information NASA is sending the rover) and downlink (what information the rover is sending to NASA).
"The downlink area where they look at the data is similar to what you've seen in like 'Apollo 13' [...] with little signs above everyone, and they're looking at information from various systems on the vehicle," Allbaugh said.
Uplink takes place on a different floor. "[Uplink is] mostly in one really large room that has a whole bunch of computers around the edge of it, and a very large table in the center with people on laptops usually as well," Allbaugh added.
As a planner, Gildner works on the uplink side of the team and said it was a struggle to mimic this flow of communication. "We are used to being able to have everyone in one room and have some conversations that are within smaller groups in one room, and then some conversations that participate with everyone," he said.
His solution: double headsets.
"What we've done is actually we set up multiple teleconferences all at once. I will have one headset called into my team of  rover drivers and we'll be chatting, and I'll have that in one ear. And then I will be called into the larger teams group and have that in my second ear. And so I'm like muting myself in between two teleconferences at once and chatting back and forth and doing this for like eight hours a day," he said.
"It does make you a bit more worn out, you have to concentrate a bit more. But it's actually worked very well ... we're able to kind of mimic what we would be doing if we were all in one place in one conference room, or one operations room, trying to work with different teams," he added.
Wearing his 3D glasses as well as his two headsets is what Gildner calls his "super nerd" look. "You've got to do both headsets at once too, because that's really key to the whole look," he said.
On March 20 a set of commands that were sent to Curiosity were successfully executed, and the robot drilled a rock sample at a location called "Edinburgh," and is now headed on to yet another drilling operation looking for rocks to analyze. In total, the robot has rolled 166 metres (545 feet) since its human operators had to set up shop at home.
For Gildner, piloting the rover has taken on a special significance during lockdown. "One of the big draws of working on a spacecraft operation, especially on Mars, is that every day we're driving to a new place and I get to look at images that no human has ever seen before," he said.
"We all get to kind of escape on Mars for a few hours every week," he added, pointing out that Curiosity's photos are also uploaded for the public to see, should anyone else care to escape to Mars.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Meet Goes Free, Microsoft Flags Double Spaces…And Other Small Business Tech News</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here are five things in technology that happened this past week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?
1 — Google Meet is going free as it guns for Zoom and aims to fend off Microsoft Teams.    
Google announced this past week that it is going to begin making their video conferencing platform—Meet—free, as a way to stay competitive with video conference giants Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google Meet has received an influx of new users who are now having to work from home. Google plans to implement the feature slowly to more users in order to make sure that all goes smoothly. Users with a G Suite account will be able to opt-in for alerts in order to be notified of when they can start using Meet. (Source: ZDNet)
Why this is important for your business:
There will be many changes to our workplaces in the future because of the Coronavirus pandemic and one of them will be the increased use of video conferencing and collaboration systems. Zoom has been getting all the attention, but its rivals–Google, Microsoft, GoToMeeting, Citrix and others–are going to compete aggressively for your attention with free deals and other incentives.
2 — Microsoft Word now flags double spaces as errors, ending the great space debate.
Microsoft Word will now highlight when a user puts two spaces after a punctuation mark, flagging it as an error and ending the confusion surrounding this practice in the past. Now—when users are typing—if they accidentally—or intentionally—put two spaces after a punctuation, Microsoft Word will provide the option to fix the double space to a single. Microsoft began troubleshooting the new update through Word’s desktop version and also been providing recommendations using the Word app Editor feature. (Source: The Verge)
Why this is important for your business:
To double space or not to double space? That’s been an age old question and now Microsoft is taking a stand. Get ready for lots of new grammatical errors in your company’s communications (as if there aren’t a lot already!).
3 —National Business League rolled out a $1.8 million platform to connect black businesses with technology amid COVID-19.
This past week, the National Business League Inc.—also known as NBL—is going to utilize their new 1.8 million user platform to help minimize the divide that exists digitally due to the COVID-19 pandemic among black-owned small businesses. (Source: Black Enterprise)
Why this is important for your business:
If you’re a black-owned company then pay attention: NBL rolled out their newest technology platform along with many other initiatives to help businesses like yours, which will include the creation of a new mobile app and website. NBL plans to utilize social media platforms, online virtual entrepreneurial and educational training, live streaming, and additional services to help the gap among black-owned businesses that exists regarding technology.
4 —Without cloud computing, businesses would now be in even deeper trouble.    
According to Canalys—an analyst firm—$107 billion were spent on cloud-computing services all over the world last year. That amount is 37% more than in 2018. It is predicted that public cloud services will rise to 17% this year, totaling $266.4 billion. With the COVID-19 pandemic changing the way businesses run and employees work, the investment in cloud computing has allowed the transition to working from home happen relatively smoothly for many companies. If the Coronavirus had hit in 2010, businesses would have been in even bigger trouble, with only $6,300 a year being spent on cloud computing during that time. (Source: ZDNet)
Why this is important for your business:
If you’re not convinced that leveraging cloud is a good thing to do, the coronavirus pandemic should have convinced you that the cloud is now and essential thing to do. Even if you have desktop or older applications, you can still move them to a managed server environment. The important takeaway is that you need to have a cloud strategy for your small business going forward.
5— Phishing scams are targeting SMBs seeking COVID aid.   
According to data shared by BleepingComputer.com, the relief provided for the coronavirus pandemic through the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security) has opened new opportunities for scammers to take advantage of business owners looking for help.. (Source: Pymnts)
Why this is important for your business:
According to the data, those behind the scams try to trick business owners by sending out emails pretending to be the Payment Protection Program (PPP). The idea behind the fraudulent emails is to try and fool individuals in choosing relief options for their businesses using official-looking log-in pages in an attempt to lift important corporate information.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Meet: You can now start or join a video meeting from Gmail account</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Everyone around the world is depending a lot on video calling platforms to connect with friends and family members during the coronaviruspandemic time. Since the lockdown, video calling platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and others have recorded all-time high video calling sessions on their respective platform. To offer a seamless experience to users, Google Meet is getting better with every passing day. Last week Google announced that Google Meet will be now available for free for everyone across the world until September 30 including enterprises.
The initiative is clearly to take on rivals Zoom, Skype, and others. The company is now making it, even more, easier to start or join a Google Meet meeting. This is a new update and you will find it when you open your Gmail account by inserting your ID and password.
You can find the Google Meet option on the left under the compose option. The option will be listed as “Meet” with two more options underneath: Start a meeting and Join a meeting. Just click on the option as per your convenience. The option is currently seen only on Gmail for desktop and not mobile.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Internet Agrees That Elon Musk is Deus Ex's Trillionaire Villain, Not JC Denton</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This post originally appeared on Kotaku UK.
Yesterday, noted embarrassing smoker, bad driver, and worse tweeter who is also somehow a billionaire Elon Musk has decided he’s JC Denton, the hero of 2000’s genre-defining cyberpunk immersive sim Deus Ex. Nobody agrees with him.
Musk has spent the past couple days yelling to his 33.4 million Twitter followers about how it’s time to “FREE AMERICA NOW” instead of continuing to impose shelter-in-place orders that slow the spread of covid-19. To drive home his point about how it’s actually modern fascism to recommend social distancing based on models followed by other countries who’ve done a much better job of containing the virus than us, Musk changed his Twitter avatar to a picture of JC Denton from Deus Ex.
He’s also propped up the opinions of millionaires and conspiracy hucksters who definitely don’t have any personal stake in sacrificing thousands of lives at the sputtering blood altar of industry. Clearly, he doesn’t either. I’m sure he had other reasons when he unsuccessfully tried to force his employees to come to work in direct violation of shelter-in-place orders. Obviously, Musk is a reliable source on covid-19, given that, back in March, he famously prognosticated that there would be “probably close to zero new cases” in the U.S. by “the end of April.” It is the end of April. According to our sister site Gizmodo, there are still almost tens of thousands of new cases reported daily across the country and around 2,000 new deaths per day. The U.S. death toll currently sits at above 61,000, surpassing that of the Vietnam War.
The JC Denton profile pic might be a reference to an unrelated meme that sprung up on YouTube last year, or Musk might be attempting to draw a comparison between our current situation and the plot of Deus Ex, in which a pandemic known as “the Gray Death” runs rampant across the globe. Denton himself is an agent who discovers that the anti-terrorist coalition he’s a part of is actually trying to keep a vaccine from reaching anybody other than powerful, wealthy elites; he defects, risking his own life in the process. Ultimately, he finds out a trillionaire businessman named Bob Page is behind everything, using both the virus and his company’s stranglehold on the vaccine as a means of exerting control over society.
On Twitter, people have taken to pointing out the obvious: Musk isn’t JC Denton, the guy opposed to the power-mad mega-wealthy arsehole. He’s Bob Page, the aforementioned power-mad mega-wealthy arsehole.
If you keep abreast of what billionaires are up to these days (and who doesn’t, given that our fates dangle from horrible strings they grasp in their engorged hands), you might recognise some of Page’s greatest hits. Notably, he at one point donates a paltry 10 million credits to help those who’ve caught the Gray Death and goes on about how sad it all makes him while not actually giving a shit. The donation never makes it to clinics, either, which gives me mad déjà vu for some reason, but I can’t put my finger on why.
Page’s ultimate goal, meanwhile, is to merge with a mega-powered AI and become god, restructuring society in his own image. Musk, thankfully, has no such pretensions toward egomaniacal immortality, unlike his fellow hyper-wealthy people (though he does own a company that he claims is working on a Deus Ex-like brain-computer interface). He just wants to be in charge of moving society to Mars. Restructuring it in his image, presumably, would just be a happy byproduct born of necessity and definitely not an ego the size of the planet itself. Also, a lot of people would probably die in the process, but that’s neither here nor there.
All of this leads me to wonder: Has Musk, a self-styled gamer, even played Deus Ex? But I don’t think it really matters. He’s insanely rich in a country that bends over backward to cater to the whims of wealthy sociopaths. In the past four weeks – with the pandemic at its peak – America’s billionaire class has added $308 billion to its wealth, in part due to government handouts that disproportionately favoured the wealthy. This includes Musk who, according to The Guardian, saw his net worth increase by over $1 billion.
Musk can say whatever he wants, do whatever he wants, and play whatever he wants without fear of consequence. As with anything else he’s ever done, he’s using his gargantuan platform to meme us into oblivion because he wants even more attention and money. He will continue to receive those things in incalculable abundance until death mercifully reduces him to luxury worm food. And if he manages to dodge that by fashioning a low-poly, JC-Denton-looking cyber body to match his PS1-ass cyber truck, then god help us all.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here’s What’s Happening With Elon Musk’s Twitter Picture</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So, Elon Musk is having what the internet might call a “normal one”. The billionaire Tesla CEO is no stranger to social media explosions, but his twitter feed over the past two days has been exceptional even by those standards. Much of this is doesn’t require too much explanation: he pivoted on Friday from talking about how businesses needed to open despite the risk of coronoavirus to more existential content, saying that he was going to sell all his possessions and that his girlfriend was mad at him. He also changed his profile picture, which might confuse someone not all that familiar with video game history.
The game from his profile picture is Deus Ex, released in 2000 by Eidos Interactive and Square Enix. It’s a seminal cyberpunk game and one of the sterling examples of interactive sims and first-person RPGs, but its setting is probably a little more relevant here. In it, a conspiracy has released a man-made plague called the Gray Death as a kind of mass culling pandemic, and are using their military might to restrict access to the vaccine.
It’s relevant to our current situation in broad strokes, mostly, but also in the more specific notion of a deadly disease that disproportionately effects the already poor.
It’s unclear what, exactly, Musk wishes to communicate by bringing Deus Ex into an already perplexing Twitter rant, but most on social media have pointed out that he bears a certain resemblance to the power-hungry billionaire that becomes the game’s main antagonist. Musk recently attempted to force his employees to show up to work despite the statewide stay-at-home order, and has vocally downplayed the seriousness of COVID-19 for months.
In the game, Page’s ultimate plan is to merge with an AI to become a kind of all-powerful God, which does seem like it would be up Musk’s alley. Again, his choice to switch his profile picture to plague-oriented fiction doesn’t seem like a coincidence given the current circumstances, but it’s unclear what, beyond that, he’s trying to say.
Tesla stock was down more than 10% at market close on Friday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID and HR Tech: How HR can use smart AI tools</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Covid-19 and the resultant impact on the economy have necessitated growth oriented organisations to rethink their business offerings, processes and business models. Business leaders are engrossed with the thinking around how to rejuvenate their businesses using lean principles with an eye on preserving their cash. HR leaders are therefore required to support their business leaders in purposeful ways which would enable the businesses to continue to function while the changes are being introduced.
At the heart of this change management process is people and this is the time that businesses would need to know what talent to retain, what new specialist talent to hire and how productive is the talent that is working from home. There are many digital technologies that have transformative impact on HR but have not yet become mainstream. Now is the time that business and HR would see significant advantage in adopting them.
AI and analytics tools, for instance, have been implemented in various functions but not so much in HR. In these times, these tools could enable swift and smart decision-making that can not only save capital but also have the ability to help build the future with smart resourcing and realignment of resources retained who could be quickly upskilled or cross-skilled based on the detailing of their competencies.
With work from home having become an essential way to continue to do business, HR managers would have to work in close tandem with IT managers in the areas of data security, confidentiality and compliances. Many organisations ‘certify’ employees for their knowledge of compliances based on the online courses employees are advised to take.
Smart AI tools from startups like Ahura are now being deployed for checking the exact time spent on the material vs watching TV or spending time on social media during the course and by monitoring their eye contacts it is now possible to provide meaningful feedback to the employees as well as their managers on the efficacy of learning.
Wearables have been touted as fashion accessories and there have been attempts to use them in the context of fitness and health but have not become mainstream so far. Covid- 19 is probably the reason why employees could be encouraged by HR managers to adopt wearables as they would be able to access data related to corona virus parameters and alert employees from the likely infection or coming to work or manage quarantine processes. Smart wrist band Tracesafe used in Hong Kong could be used to suggest which employees should work from home necessarily and thus prevent the entire office going into quarantine mode.
Since remote learning has come to stay, L&D managers have to identify learning platforms which not only have the ability to host content but can deliver content to employees as per their individual needs based on skill requirements. Since organisations would be interested in deploying a talent pool comprising employees as well as gig economy workers, HR and business managers would benefit by using learning and HR systems that provide real-time skills status and enable planning for upskilling or new resourcing based on this information.
New business models, changes in work norms and new methods for assessing people – not by experience or education but on their sheer capabilities would be adopted by organisations. Digital transformation that has skipped HR function in many organisations has now assumed urgency and as a result we would see several digital technologies that have been given cursory consideration in the past getting assimilated and becoming mainstream.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How To Stop Relying On Consultants By Building Your Company’s Innovation Capabilities</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Post Covid-19, company leaders are going to be dealing with a lot of challenges. In addition to stabilizing their core business, leaders will also be thinking about how they can use innovation to drive new growth. The challenge for most organizations will be that they have historically neglected to develop the necessary innovation skills among their employees. In the constant drive for efficiency, some leaders have been actively hostile to innovation teams, viewing them as a waste of resources. 
When disruption occurs, it becomes difficult for companies that do not already have an innovation muscle to respond.  Post Covid-19, companies are going to have to build innovation muscles in the middle of a crisis. It’s hard to reimagine the future with a group of employees that have been drilled to run the core business efficiently. Giving these people an opportunity to work on innovation projects will not be enough. They will inevitably lack the right skills to design new  business models, identify risky assumptions or run the right experiments to test new business ideas.
Innovation Coaches
The other challenge that corporate employees will face is time and resource. This has always been a challenge. However, when companies are in crisis mode, time and resources become even more precious.  Most people working in large companies will not have enough hours in their working week to build up the right skills for innovation. So when they start working on a project, they will be unsure what to do. 
This is where coaching can really help. When employees have limited time and skills, surrounding them with the good innovation coaches can help move projects forward. A good option for companies is to use external consultants as innovation coaches. This option is good because it can at least help you to get started. What you don’t want, however, is to completely outsource your innovation capabilities to external consultants.  
It is better for companies to use consultants as a bridge towards building their own internal innovation capabilities. I strongly believe that every company needs to have its own group of internal innovation coaches. This is an important innovation muscle to have. So when we work with consultants, we must not just use them to execute and deliver our innovation projects. We must also leverage their presence in our company  to train an internal group of coaches. 
Catalysts + Coaches
At Intuit they train internal coaches through a program called Catalyst. They recruit internal coaches and train them on their Design for Delight innovation process (D4D). They have been doing this for several years and have built up a great group of internal coaches to support their innovation teams.  At Pearson, when they were rolling out the Lean Product Lifecycle, they had a train-the-trainer program that focused on building the innovation skills of selected employees. 
When building up your group of internal innovation coaches, it is important to select the right people. It is not sufficient for people to have an interest in innovation or working on innovation projects. You need to recruit people that are passionate about innovation and equally passionate about teaching innovation to others. This is how you can spread best practices throughout the organization. 
The Program
Based on my experience working with several large organizations, I have outlined below the steps you can use to run a successful train-the-trainer program. This approach is not formulaic and can be adapted to suit your company context. What is important is that you leverage the presence of consultants in your company to build up the right level of skill within your group of internal coaches, so that they can work independently going forward: 
As a company, you can set the requirements in terms of the number of hours of shadowing and coaching that are required before a person becomes a certified coach. It is also important to recruit coaches from all over the business, who are then deployed to help teams within their divisions or business units. This will allow innovation best practices to be spread across the company by passionate advocates. 
The Community
It is also important to turn our coaches into a community of innovation practitioners. We need to create a range of possibilities for them to interact and learn from each other. Creating a community gets rid of isolation and provides innovators with the knowledge that they are not alone in the company – there are others like them. 
As such, we should start building a community by organising regular meetups where people can share best practice. These meetups can feature external speakers. You can also run a weekly lean coffee meeting. People can turn up, select topics and spend an hour discussing their challenges and successes.
Beyond meeting face to face, we can also use digital tools to create our community. For example, we could host weekly or monthly webinars where we discuss various innovation topics. We can also create a digital platform with blogs, videos and an interactive page. The goal is to have a strong community of practitioners that are continuously getting better at their craft. This is how we can stop relying on consultants and build our own innovation capabilities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Microsoft Leak Confirms Powerful Surface Book 3 Features</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More details on Microsoft’sSurface Book 3 have been published, with the latest information coming from the certification of the Windows 10 powered laptop by Energy Star.
The certifications cover the top-end models of the 13-inch and 15-inch Surface Book machines, with both porting Intel’s Core-i7 processor and 32 GB of RAM. Windows Latest reports:
Given the listed speed of the i7 processor, it looks like the Surface Book 3 will be using Intel’s Ice Lake-U processors. This matches the chipsets used in the Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro 7 devices launched in October 2019, and there’s a certain practicality in using the same close family of chips across the full range.
One other detail that jumps out is the ‘Date Available On Market’, with both machines listing ’05/01/2020’. That doesn’t mean that they were on retail shelves on that date, but it does suggest that the hardware is ready to go on sale.
Microsoft has not confirmed a release date, but many are expecting the Surface Book 3 to arrive in June.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Surface Book 3 specs revealed by Energy Star certification filing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Back in 2019, Microsoft refreshed the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop lineup with new specs but did not talk about Surface Book 3. However, we have seen a lot of leaks confirming the existence of the Surface Book 3 and recent FCC filing suggest an imminent launch.
Now, the folks over at Windows Latest have uncovered Energy Star certification that seems to confirm the specs of both 13-inch and 15-inch Surface Book 3. According to the filing, the 15-inch Surface Book 3 will come with an Intel Core i7 processor with 4 physical CPU cores. It's not clear if Microsoft will be using Intel's latest 10th Generation mobile processors. Intel currently has a mobile CPU that matches the information in the filing. The Intel i7-1065G7 mobile CPU comes with 4 cores and 8 threads and a base frequency of 1.30 GHz. Apart from that, the laptop will also come with 32 GB of RAM. The filing does not reveal information related to the GPU but previous leaks suggest that the laptop may come with Nvidia's top-of-the-line Quadro GPU.
Moving on to the 13-inch Surface Book 3, the Energy Star filing reveals the same Intel i7 processor along with 32 GB of RAM. Again the filing does not mention anything about the GPU but previous leaks point towards the use of GeForce GTX 1650 Max-Q and GTX 1660 Ti Max-Q graphics.
Microsoft is expected to launch the Surface Book 3 soon. There is no word on the pricing but we expect a premium pricing as Microsoft might position Surface Book 3 as a powerhouse for creators on the go.

    <h5 class="mb-1">France's COVID-19 tracing app expected to enter testing in week of May 11</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS (Reuters) - France’s state-supported “StopCOVID” contact-tracing app should enter its testing phase in the week of May 11 when the country starts to unwind its lockdown, a government minister said on Sunday.
Minister for Digital Affairs Cedric O, a member of President Emmanuel Macron’s inner circle, presented the app as a key element of France’s strategy to stave off the coronavirus as authorities grapple with the prospect of mass testing.
“There’s nothing magical about this app, but it’s not technological coquetry either,” O wrote on online publishing platform Medium. “It’s only useful if it’s integrated into a global health system.”
Countries are rushing to develop apps to assess the risk of one person infecting another, helping to isolate those who could spread the disease.
Like others in Europe, France has chosen the short-range Bluetooth “handshakes” between devices as the best approach, dismissing the alternative of using location data pursued by some countries in Asia as intrusive.
But debate has raged about whether to log such contacts on individual devices or on a central server - which would be more directly useful to existing contact tracing teams that work phones and knock on doors to warn those who may be at risk.
France has so far opted for a “centralised” approach, which would need Apple in particular to change the settings on its iPhones. The smartphone maker has refused to budge, although discussions with the U.S. company were ongoing, O said.
“French health and technological sovereignty ... is the freedom for our country to be able to have the choice and not be constrained by the choices of a large company, however innovative and efficient it may be,” O wrote.
France’s most important European partner, Germany, changed course last week over which type of smartphone technology it wanted to use, backing an approach supported by Google and Apple along with a growing number of other European countries.
(This story has been refiled to correct headline and first paragraph to make clearer that testing will start in the week beginning May 11)

    <h5 class="mb-1">France will start testing its COVID-19 tracking app the week of May 11th</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">France was one of the first countries scrambling to create a COVID-19 contact tracing app, and now it’s close to finding out how its app works in practice. Digital Affairs Minister Cedric O has stated (via Reuters) that France’s StopCOVID should enter real-world testing the week of May 11th, right as the country will start easing pandemic lockdown measures. He didn’t say when the app might be ready for widespread use, although that’s likely to depend on initial results.
And before you ask: no, France isn’t budging on its desire to loosen Apple’s Bluetooth restrictions for the sake of the app. While O acknowledged that both France’s centralized approach (which stores identifiers for positive contacts in one place) had Apple’s decentralized method had flaws, he argued that the method supported by iOS was “crippling.” It allegedly had inferior data protections and gave up control, making it difficult for a health authority to learn from info without asking tech companies.
The minister was aware that trusting a central organization created the potential for abuse, but saw French control of health policy as a “sovereign prerogative” that shouldn’t be handed over to private companies. He also noted that France would move forward regardless of whether or not Apple changed its mind. The iPhone version is “satisfactory,” he said. Still, it’s clear the French government is hoping Apple will bend by the time StopCovid is widely available.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indonesia's Tokopedia probes alleged data leak of 91 million users</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Tokopedia, Indonesia’s largest e-commerce platform, said it was investigating an attempted hack and claims that the details of millions of its users had been leaked online.
“We found that there had been an attempt to steal data from Tokopedia users,” a spokesman for the company said in a statement late Saturday.
“However, Tokopedia ensures that crucial information such as passwords remains successfully protected behind encryption.”
“At this moment, we continue to investigate further into this matter and there is no additional information that we can share,” the statement added.
Data breach monitoring firm Under the Breach published a Twitter post on Saturday showing screenshots from an unnamed individual who claimed he had acquired the personal details of 15 million Tokopedia users during a March 2020 hack on the e-commerce site.
According to the screenshots, which show names, emails and birthdays, the hacker alleges he or she is in possession of a much bigger user database and asks for assistance to “crack” users’ passwords.
Under the Breach, which monitors cyber crime, said on Sunday the hacker had updated the post to offer the details of 91 million users for “$5,000 on the Darknet”. The firm shared a screenshot of the hacker’s proposed offer posted online.
Backed by $2 billion in funding from investors including SoftBank Group Corp’s Vision Fund and Alibaba, Tokopedia, whose founder and CEO William Tanuwijaya is one of the country’s most prominent tech entrepreneurs, claims more than 90 million monthly active users.
A Tokopedia spokesman declined to comment directly on the hacker’s claims, but told Reuters on Sunday that “all transactions with all payments methods at Tokopedia ... remain secure.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sonos may finally be releasing a new Playbar</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Sonos Playbar may finally, at long last, be getting an upgrade, according to an image discovered by Dave Zatz over at Zatz Not Funny. The renders don’t show a power outlet or HDMI ports, which Zatz speculates may mean ports and any buttons are either recessed within the ledge or elsewhere along the sound bar (although it may also mean the renders are just not fully illustrated). Zatz’s images show both black and white versions.
Sonos debuted the Playbar in 2013, and there hasn’t been an update since. According to 9to5 Mac, the new Playbar will have support for Dolby Atmos, and Zatz says Apple AirPlay 2 support is likely as well. Sonos may also be planning new versions of its Play:5 wireless speaker and Sub subwoofer, 9to5 Mac reported, which Zatz says he’s confirmed.
In March, Sonos announced details of its Sonos S2 operating system, due to be released in June. The company said S2 will power “the next generation” of Sonos products and experiences.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A company render of the new Sonos Playbar has been leaked. The image was posted by Zatz Not Funny earlier today.Beyond drastically different styling of Sonos’ first home theater offering, coming in both white and black, Apple AirPlay 2 seems like a lock and Dolby Atmos rumors are swirling. However, these company renders are incomplete given the missing power outlet and nary an HDMI port to be found — which is a requirement for the higher fidelity audio format. Zatz theorizes that the either the back plate isn't fully illustrated or perhaps additional ports and buttons are recessed within the ledge or placed elsewhere. He believes the Playbar will support HDMI Arc but is unlikely to have multiple HDMI inputs."I believe it’s highly likely the Playbar will feature HDMI ARC, like the Beam. But, given what I’ve seen, I believe it’s highly unlikely it’ll contain multiple HDMI inputs like some Sony and LG provide. "Zatz also confirmed reports that Sonos is working on a new Sub and Play:5. The current Sonos Playbar is now on sale for $549, a discount of $150 off its list price of $699. Likewise, the Sub is also on sale for $549, down from $699.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Older Queenslanders embracing new tech from video calls to blogging</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Queensland's mature-aged residents are embracing technology to stay connected amid the state's coronavirus restrictions, enforced to keep them safe during the global pandemic.
The general manager of STAR Community Services, Patsy Wilshire, said the not-for-profit aged-care service provider's STAR Tech program was teaching older Queenslanders to use online resources to ensure they didn't get left behind in the digital world.
"Technology can support seniors to not only maintain their social connections, but in fact improve the quality of their life via online shopping, banking and other digital services," Ms Wilshire said.
Ipswich resident Bobby Flower, 81, is one of the program's many participants using newly learnt technology skills to stay in touch with family via regular video calls.
"It is difficult to not have my grandson over for visits, but we talk every day through video calls," he said.
"We share our day’s activities with each other."
Victoria Point residents Dorothy and Michael Byrnes are learning about apps and blogging.
"It breaks up our day," they said.
"By learning new online skills, we are able to focus on something productive."
Other residents are using their skills to exercise with their weekly group online, access e-books and tune into radio stations via an app.
Helen McCullough, 69, is sharpening her focus and memory skills with online brain-training games.
"They are very engaging," she said.
"My family emails me links to interesting quizzes and trivia to try out. I look forward to the challenge."
Queensland communities have not forgotten their older population, with strangers writing chalk messages in front of aged-care facilities.
A Holland Park couple has created a work of art outside that suburb's Duhig Village – Southern Cross Care in Brisbane after a reduction of visits amid coronavirus fears.
Earlier this month, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk launched a "care army" to help vulnerable neighbours and those over the age of 65.
"We want to protect 1 million seniors. If we can look after our most vulnerable, we can prevent them from ending up in hospital, or even in ICU," she said at the time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Cyprus launches voluntary tracking app to halt spread</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cyprus' government has encouraged the use of a mobile phone app that locates people who may have come into contact with someone who has Covid-19.
The app allows people who test positive to coronavirus to share this information with public health authorities, who are then able to trace anyone who may have been in close proximity to them.
The app is called COVTRACER and it was developed in partnership with a government-funded research centre, Cyprus' Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy said today.
It also said that the use of this app is entirely voluntary.
Another mobile tracing app based on Bluetooth technology was abandoned due to privacy concerns.
The ministry said Cyprus backs a coordinated European approach in terms of tracing apps that might improve the management of COVID-19 across the continent, as well as speed up border openings as travel restrictions get lifted.
A stay-at-home order in Cyprus is set to ease on Monday, when retail stores will be allowed to reopen.
A nighttime curfew will remain in place until restrictions on movement are completely lifted, a move which is scheduled for May 21.
Health Minister Constantinos Ioannou said this week that flights to and from the island nation would resume after June 9, depending on how the pandemic unfolds.
To date, Cyprus has more than 860 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 20 deaths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cyprus backs voluntary tracking app use to halt virus spread</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NICOSIA, Cyprus — The government of Cyprus is encouraging the voluntary use of a locally developed cellphone application designed to locate people who may have come into contact with someone carrying the coronavirus.
The country’s Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy said Saturday that the COVTRACER app, developed in partnership with a government-funded research centre, uses GPS information to track an individual’s daily movements.
That information gets stored in the mobile phone’s log file and would be available for users who test positive for the virus to share with public health authorities. The authorities would then use the data to trace anyone who who may have been in close proximity to the infected person.
The ministry said use of the app is “strictly voluntary” and only cellphone owners can make the data available to health authorities.
Another mobile tracing app based on Bluetooth technology was shelved due to privacy concerns.
The government ministry said Cyprus backs a co-ordinated European approach to tracing apps that might help with the management of COVID-19 across the continent and speed up border openings as travel restrictions are lifted.
A stay-at-home order in Cyprus is set to ease Monday, when retail stores will be allowed to reopen. A nighttime curfew will remain in place until restrictions on movement are completely lifted, a move scheduled for May 21.
Health Minister Constantinos Ioannou said this week that flights to and from the island nation would resume after June 9, depending on how the pandemic unfolds.
To date, Cyprus has 857 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 15 deaths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New apps emerge amid COVID-19 to tackle gripes with popular delivery services</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- When the weekend rolls around, Torontonians won't have to miss the White Lily Diner's thick-cut bacon, organic corn grits and toast smeared in rhubarb hibiscus jam just because the country has plunged into a pandemic.
The east-end diner is selling its brunch staples and offering to drop them at customers' doors, but the process won't involve any of the familiar delivery apps whose couriers have become a fixture on busy streets in recent years.
Instead of relying on Uber Eats, SkipTheDishes or DoorDash, White Lily is using a new entrant to the market: Tock To Go.
"The biggest draw off the bat was probably just the fact that they're so much less expensive," said White Lily co-owner Ashley Lloyd, who laid off her entire staff when she closed the restaurant to dine-in meals amid COVID-19.
"Restaurant margins are slim...I can understand people turning to (their delivery competitors), but honestly I don't know how they do it."
Tock To Go is part of a new wave of food delivery companies hitting the Canadian market, hoping to attract vendors with features like lower commissions and fill the hole Foodora will leave behind when it shutters its Canadian operations in mid-May.
The services -- Ottawa's Love Local Delivery, Vancouver's From To, Toronto's volunteer-run iRover and new delivery features on Montreal's Eva -- have been created to help out in a tough moment, when restaurants are barely scraping by -- even as demand for food delivery surges.
These services want to do things differently from the household names, so they have eliminated commission fees or offered rates well below the 10- to 30-per cent charged by Uber Eats, SkipTheDishes, DoorDash and others.
Tock To Go, a Chicago-based service from restaurateur Nick Kokonas that evolved from his Tock reservation system, only takes a 3 per cent commission from restaurants in Vancouver and Toronto.
Tock first appeared in the cities in 2018, but didn't launch Tock to Go until the pandemic started. Tock to Go doesn't have couriers to deliver meals. Instead, it asks customers to pre-order food, helping restaurants arrange their own delivery.
"Ordering apps take up to 20 to 30 (per cent), which simply is not sustainable for restaurants," Tock's director of marketing Kyle Welter said in an email.
"Tock allows each restaurant to specify the number of orders for any set time range, so the kitchen doesn't get overwhelmed and they can responsibly manage the flow of customers."
Over in B.C., Brandon Grossutti from Gastown restaurant Pidgin will launch From To, a delivery service with a handful of Vancouver eateries, in May.
In the weeks before restaurants in Canada closed to stop the spread of COVID-19, Grossutti realized Pidgin would need a takeout option, so he signed up with Uber Eats and Burnaby-based Fantuan Delivery.
"Then the reality of it hit. We did fairly well gross wise, but you see the checks coming in and...the first week was a lot of money out the door in commissions," said Grossutti, who had to lay off workers
"It's a weirdly parasitic relationship where you have a parasite basically eating its hosts until it dies and it's not a sustainable relationship."
Grossutti decided to put his software industry background to work. He made From To, which gives restaurants the ability to decide if they want to pay for, split with or pass on customers' delivery costs.
From To currently takes no commission.
"We had talked at certain points about taking like 5 per cent, which would be much less than what's out there, but we realized that during this time we need to make this sustainable because people are already losing money," Grossutti said.
The lower commissions don't seem to have bothered rivals.
"We welcome new competitors to the market, as it raises awareness of the industry and promotes even more traffic to restaurants to stimulate growth," Winnipeg-bred SkipTheDishes said in an email to The Canadian Press.
"It is natural for competitors to see value in this market and we're confident in Skip's position as Canada's homegrown food delivery company."
SkipTheDishes is offering a 10.5 per cent commission deal to restaurants wanting to do their own deliveries but still use the platform and is expediting payments to all businesses using its services.
Meanwhile, San Francisco-based Uber Eats is eliminating its fees on pickup orders and reducing its usual 30 per cent charges to 15 per cent for restaurants who choose to use their own delivery people.
DoorDash, also headquartered in San Francisco, is waiving April commission fees for new, independent clients. Existing independent clients can have those fees waived on pickup orders, and 100,000 clients were added to DashPass -- its subscription program which offers $0 delivery for consumers -- for free.
Harriet Clunie, the executive chef at European-style bistro Das Lokal, said that is not enough because the moves put the onus on restaurateurs to offset costs or hire their own delivery staff to take advantage of benefits.
She banded together with other members of the Ottawa restaurant community to found Love Local Delivery, a service that launched in March and will courier food within 5 kilometres of restaurants for a flat $5 fee, or more for longer distances.
There are no commission fees right now and the service focuses solely on independently-owned restaurants.
While it might have to charge commission when it launches an app in the near future, Clunie said the service is committed to keeping that potential fee low.
"It's all people that are in the same boat and we're trying to help everybody that's struggling, restaurants or small businesses or drivers that are unemployed and just trying to make some money to feed the family," she said.
"It's an approach that's really trying to lift everybody up."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Invasion of privacy': Watchdogs concerned about apps tracking COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER - Privacy watchdogs are voicing concerns over proposals across the country to implement smartphone apps to help track COVID-19.
New Brunswick, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan are among the provinces looking at or planning on creating smartphone apps that would track a user's whereabouts.
Alberta is the first province to launch an app.
Known as contact tracing, the apps track those who the user comes in to contact with, commonly by monitoring a device's Bluetooth signal.
The use of the technology, and the information the apps gather, has become a subject of debate in Canada.
"When we develop these sorts of tools or applications, we're entering into a totally new class or form of surveillance," said Christopher Parsons, a senior research associate at Citizen Lab, part of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Policy. "We’ve never had that level of surveillance in this country."
Parsons, whose research focuses on data privacy and security, said governments may have good intentions but they need to be prepared for the long-term implications of collecting such data.
"If the government doesn't communicate what government organizations can or can't collect with any kind of tracing application, it will almost certainly disenfranchise individuals," he said.
The reaction at various government levels to creating and implementing the apps has been mixed.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government has received a number of proposals but understands that Canadians value their privacy and need certain assurances.
Alberta launched its app, called ABTraceTogether, on Friday. It uses Bluetooth signals to track users and if you're diagnosed with COVID-19, it will contact those you may have come into contact with.
The province said no identifiable information is exchanged between the app users and geolocation data will not be collected.
A spokesman for New Brunswick's Ministry of Health said its app would allow those diagnosed with COVID-19 to send an anonymous message to those they have come in contact with.
Other provinces are taking a wait-and-see approach.
British Columbia is not looking at contact tracing apps at this time, while a spokesperson for Ontario's Health Ministry said no decision has been made.
Only Quebec has strongly pushed back against using contact tracing technology and apps.
"Geolocation cannot replace the contact tracing actions carried out by the public-health departments. In addition, it must not at any time make it possible to identify an individual, in particular, a person suffering from COVID-19," the Quebec Health Ministry said in a statement.
The discussion prompted Canada's privacy commissioner to release a framework for governments. It says collected data should be destroyed when the pandemic ends and that measures must be science-based and "necessary to achieve a specific identified purpose."
"During a crisis, laws can be applied flexibly and contextually, but they must still apply. Our framework aims to focus on what we believe are the most relevant principles in context, without abandoning others," said commissioner Daniel Therrien.
Dr. Peter Phillips, an infectious disease expert at the University of British Columbia, said privacy rights aren't the only issue and Canadians need to make sacrifices based on the benefit for public health.
"Rather than just assuming this is an unacceptable intrusion on people's privacy, there are potentially substantial benefits to be had by having public health response use technology," he said in an interview.
Phillips agreed that privacy issues must be handled carefully.
"The rights of those people who are not yet infected with COVID need to be taken into account as well, because if we don't do everything that we can to contain this by way of public health, then people are going to get sick and some of them will die."
Other countries using such apps are promising to keep a close eye on how the data is used and shared.
Australia launched COVIDSafe and has promised to take only minimal data from its users. Italy has decreed that the information its app collects will remain anonymous and be destroyed by the end of the year.
The rise in popularity of the apps even prompted a joint effort from Google and Apple to allow programming interfaces to work together to share data. Those with Android or Apple smartphone products will both be able to better share data to allow developers to create tracing apps.
The plan, the companies said, is to launch Bluetooth tracing software in the coming months.
In Canada, there are concerns about oversight and guidelines on how the information will be shared.
"It really is an extraordinary invasion of privacy for a democratic state to request," said Brenda McPhail, the director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s privacy, technology and surveillance project.
She said there would need to be an equally extraordinary level of oversight.
Geoffrey Rotstein, CEO of Toronto company EQ Works, said he's aware of the concerns.
His company is developing an app that would track a smartphone's Bluetooth technology but would keep a user's data stored on their phone, not a server.
"We believe we could develop something that becomes a very proactive notification tool," he said. "So, we can proactively identify people in places at risk and help protect people's lives and help get life back to normal faster."
Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said this week that in addition to privacy concerns, the technology itself remains unproven and will need to be refined to ensure false positives and other issues do not emerge.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Invasion of privacy': Watchdogs concerned about apps tracking COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER -- Privacy watchdogs are voicing concerns over proposals across the country to implement smartphone apps to help track COVID-19.
New Brunswick, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan are among the provinces looking at or planning on creating smartphone apps that would track a user's whereabouts.
Alberta is the first province to launch an app.
Known as contact tracing, the apps track those who the user comes in to contact with, commonly by monitoring a device's Bluetooth signal.
The use of the technology, and the information the apps gather, has become a subject of debate in Canada.
"When we develop these sorts of tools or applications, we're entering into a totally new class or form of surveillance," said Christopher Parsons, a senior research associate at Citizen Lab, part of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Policy. "We've never had that level of surveillance in this country."
Parsons, whose research focuses on data privacy and security, said governments may have good intentions but they need to be prepared for the long-term implications of collecting such data.
"If the government doesn't communicate what government organizations can or can't collect with any kind of tracing application, it will almost certainly disenfranchise individuals," he said.
The reaction at various government levels to creating and implementing the apps has been mixed.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government has received a number of proposals but understands that Canadians value their privacy and need certain assurances.
Alberta launched its app, called ABTraceTogether, on Friday. It uses Bluetooth signals to track users and if you're diagnosed with COVID-19, it will contact those you may have come into contact with.
The province said no identifiable information is exchanged between the app users and geolocation data will not be collected.
A spokesman for New Brunswick's Ministry of Health said its app would allow those diagnosed with COVID-19 to send an anonymous message to those they have come in contact with.
Other provinces are taking a wait-and-see approach.
British Columbia is not looking at contact tracing apps at this time, while a spokesperson for Ontario's Health Ministry said no decision has been made.
Only Quebec has strongly pushed back against using contact tracing technology and apps.
"Geolocation cannot replace the contact tracing actions carried out by the public-health departments. In addition, it must not at any time make it possible to identify an individual, in particular, a person suffering from COVID-19," the Quebec Health Ministry said in a statement.
The discussion prompted Canada's privacy commissioner to release a framework for governments. It says collected data should be destroyed when the pandemic ends and that measures must be science-based and "necessary to achieve a specific identified purpose."
"During a crisis, laws can be applied flexibly and contextually, but they must still apply. Our framework aims to focus on what we believe are the most relevant principles in context, without abandoning others," said commissioner Daniel Therrien.
Dr. Peter Phillips, an infectious disease expert at the University of British Columbia, said privacy rights aren't the only issue and Canadians need to make sacrifices based on the benefit for public health.
"Rather than just assuming this is an unacceptable intrusion on people's privacy, there are potentially substantial benefits to be had by having public health response use technology," he said in an interview.
Phillips agreed that privacy issues must be handled carefully.
"The rights of those people who are not yet infected with COVID need to be taken into account as well, because if we don't do everything that we can to contain this by way of public health, then people are going to get sick and some of them will die."
Other countries using such apps are promising to keep a close eye on how the data is used and shared.
Australia launched COVIDSafe and has promised to take only minimal data from its users. Italy has decreed that the information its app collects will remain anonymous and be destroyed by the end of the year.
The rise in popularity of the apps even prompted a joint effort from Google and Apple to allow programming interfaces to work together to share data. Those with Android or Apple smartphone products will both be able to better share data to allow developers to create tracing apps.
The plan, the companies said, is to launch Bluetooth tracing software in the coming months.
In Canada, there are concerns about oversight and guidelines on how the information will be shared.
"It really is an extraordinary invasion of privacy for a democratic state to request," said Brenda McPhail, the director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association's privacy, technology and surveillance project.
She said there would need to be an equally extraordinary level of oversight.
Geoffrey Rotstein, CEO of Toronto company EQ Works, said he's aware of the concerns.
His company is developing an app that would track a smartphone's Bluetooth technology but would keep a user's data stored on their phone, not a server.
"We believe we could develop something that becomes a very proactive notification tool," he said. "So, we can proactively identify people in places at risk and help protect people's lives and help get life back to normal faster."
Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said this week that in addition to privacy concerns, the technology itself remains unproven and will need to be refined to ensure false positives and other issues do not emerge.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A list of Home Internet Bundles You Should Checkout – Techjaja</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The lockdown has brought upon us many things and one of them is changing the way we work, live, consume media, and data. Previously most people would load on data bundles on the go and pretty much use office internet for the most part of the day. Now with confinement at home, usage patterns have changed and so have the data demands. You find that people now need data for work, entertainment, social networking, and other demands but in large quantities so mobile bundles just don’t cut it.
It is for this reason we’ve looked at all current market offerings and come up with the list from different internet service providers.We highly recommend a fixed internet connection for stability as mobile network connections have over and again dropped in terms of quality due to congestion.
In no particular order, we are hopeful that the home internet packages below will most likely sort your internet needs at home or wherever you might be. Some have installation fees attached but with that out of the way, they could be worth a try.

Airtel recently launched its broadband service and in a similar manner launched specific bundles to go with it. What differentiates these bundles from the rest are their large volumes for the price thus the term WiFi bundles. These are not only limited to its broadband service but so long as you have a router at home with an Airtel SIM in it, you can still enjoy the experience.
Should you choose to go the broadband route, you’ll have to part with an installation fee of UGX 280,000 and this will come with 51GB of data valid for 30 days on top of an outdoor micro-wave unit and a router. Airtel guarantees speeds of at least 10Mbps over 4G but coverage is only limited to greater Kampala as of this writing.

The rest of the pricing is as below;
Airtel also has different offerings but what stood out for us are the WakaNet bundles. Just like Airtel Broadband, these are limited in reach to areas of Kyanja, Kiwatule, Kira & Naalya and are specifically for home use.
An installation fee of UGX 245,000 comes with a 4G router and a bundle of 35GB. Other bundles are as below;
Roke Telkom is like the OG of fixed internet amongst the current players. Its prized bundles are Roke Plus promising free internet in “offpeak hours” from 7 pm to 7 am, over the weekend, and on public holidays. Normal charges apply in peak hours between 7 am – 7 pm.
Their installation fee is UGX 500,000 but is now discounted at UGX 300,000 during the COVID-19 crisis and depending on location, delivery can be via fiber or micro-wave. Roke promises speeds of at least 5Mbps for each of the following Roke Plus bundles.
Surprisingly, Smile has one of the best 4G networks but hardly gets any mention when it comes to data discussions. Over time, it has re-invented itself with some of the most flexible bundles on the market but these are our recommendations. These are delivered wirelessly via MiFis and routers.
The beauty about Zuku is its triple-play offering that combines telephony, internet & TV over fiber but you can as well opt for the internet only. Their coverage is however limited to Naguru, parts of Ntinda, Bukoto, Mutungo, and Luzira but expansion plans are underway to add other surrounding areas. Installation is free so long as you’re within the aforementioned areas and their bundles are as below;
All the Zuku packages come with free Zuku to Zuku calls and 56+ TV channels. In case you want to up the speeds, Zuku Fiber offers its Premium & Advanced packages offering 40mbos & 100mbps at UGX 297,900 and UGX 497,900 respectively.
Liquid Telecom has the cheapest bundles of all the listed players but not without caveats. Basically, their internet service is unlimited and what they regulate are the speeds much like Zuku.
However, they have a long waiting list so getting their service doesn’t come easy. A few colleagues that have it installed attest that the experience is good.
Installation for the service is also free and this is via fiber (depending on location) and micro-wave. Below are their bundles.
Liquid also has the Gold and Platinum packages with increased speeds of 40Mbps & 100Mbps at UGX 269,000 and UGX 469,000 respectively.
Let us know of any suitable data bundles or player we could have left out in the comments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Virtual life the real the new normal – what of data privacy?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Covid-19 has forced organisations to move most of their services online in a very short time. 
Schools, restaurants, hospitals, gyms, supermarkets - pretty much any service that can be digitised or streamed has quickly gone online and that is a good thing.
Who wouldn’t want the convenience of ordering their food, groceries or whatever product online and have it delivered right to their doorstep within minutes?
But do we ever stop to think of the actors behind the convenience and what they do with our personal data that they need in order to deliver our products?
It is an interesting conversation that affects each of the actors in the current ecosystem, and there risks and benefits faced by each actor.
For a supermarket to deliver that online order to your doorstep, they would rely on several third party platform providers that include the eCommerce platform as well as the transport platform.
So the supermarket would hire the eCommerce platform providers like Jumia, Glovo, Masoko and others to list the supermarket products for customers to access and buy.
In this example, the supermarket is considered the data controller while the platform provider is the data processor, collecting and processing personal data on behalf of the controller.
The personal data includes your name, telephone number, residence location, payment details, etc. needed to complete the transaction.
Indeed, there is a third player who has access to your personal data - the transport company.
But why should you care about all this?  After all, all you want is that your lunch or grocery is delivered to your doorstep in the shortest time possible.
The first reason you should care is simply that your personal data could be breached or abused by any of the above actors that you have implicitly trusted with your digital identity.
If the eCommerce platform contracted by the supermarket fails to secure your personal data and it falls into the wrong hands, you will become exposed to all manner of risks.
The easiest one that most can identify with is the financial risk, where your payment details are abused and used for fraudulent activities.
There are however additional risks relating to your residency data that could equally be abused - depending, of course, on your profile or number of people in society who for various reasons count you as their enemy.
Should you be worried about transacting online? Yes. Should you stop transacting online?  Definitely Not.
Digital economic activity is the future and what the Covid-19 crisis has done is simply bring that future closer to you.
What you need to do is to be aware of the risks that each digital opportunity presents and then start demanding your digital rights accordingly.
To help you along that journey is the Data Protection Act enacted last year, which defines the rights and obligation of each of the actors in this digital ecosystem.
There are certain expectations that the data controllers must deliver on, including securing your data and getting penalised or sanctioned as prescribed in cases of breaches.
There are also digital rights granted to you as the customer. These include but are not limited to the right to know from your supermarket how they processes your data, whom they share it with, what they have stored about you, how you can access and correct amongst others.
It is your obligation as the data subject to demand for this information from your favorite online trader as a way of mitigating the risks that you face as you continue enjoying your digital conveniences.
If you do not take up your role as prescribed in the data protection act, the data controller will only be too happy to retain total control of how they process your data – most often at your expense.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GST audit guidelines need to be reviewed to include video conferencing, says Experts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GST officers would have to audit and assess taxpayers via video-conferencing instead of undertaking physical visits amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the current guidelines need to be reviewed for this, according to experts.
As per the current goods and services tax (GST) audit guidelines, taxpayers have been broadly categorised into three groups based on their annual turnover -- large, medium and small.
While large and medium units are compulsorily under premises-based audits; for small units, desk-based audit has been suggested.
However, in the case of non-cooperative taxpayers or any inherent weakness of the internal control system, officers could shift back to the premises-based audit.
Last month, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issued instructions requiring officers to hold a personal hearing in respect of customs law, central excise and service tax laws through the video-conferencing facility.
Experts said that with the audit for the financial year 2017-18, the first year in the GST regime, yet to begin, the tax officers would need to review the audit guidelines and include video conference facility along with strengthening the risk management system to flag risky cases.
PwC India Partner National Leader (Indirect Tax) Pratik Jain said GST audit and assessment for 2017-18 will start soon and the department will have to review the audit guidelines.
"The current guidelines talk about physical visits to premises of large business for say 7-8 days and conducting audit. With social distancing being a 'new normal' now, GST officials might have to explore more virtual verifications," Jain said.
The government will have to take a re-look at its risk management system and devise better ways of assessing taxpayers, he added.
AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said one segment of the CBIC, which is Customs, has already embraced the use of technology, and now it is expected that GST having more than 1.2 crore taxpayers would also introduce such facility in all the departmental functions including assessments, adjudications, appeals, and audit.
"Introducing a video-conferencing facility in all the tax laws is imperative to the business continuity plan of the economy, otherwise, this pandemic will result in inordinate delay in the delivery of justice," Mohan added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro Specs Tested Reveal a 28W Intel 10th-Gen CPU, up to 32GB RAM and Gobs of Storage</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 2020 MacBook Air refresh was introduced by Apple recently, and thanks to its cheaper price, it’s highly likely customers will opt for this model instead of the 2019 MacBook Pro. In fact, a previous benchmark comparison between two notebooks revealed that the 2020 MacBook Air’s improved performance and cheaper starting price is why you should opt to get it in the first place. However, if you were looking for a faster and portable machine, then perhaps these 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro specs might impress you.
The last time we talked about Apple’s 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro specs, the model allegedly being tested featured 32GB RAM and 2TB of SSD storage. As for the CPU, the test showed an Intel 10th-generation Core i7-1068NG7, and according to the latest details shared by _rogame on Twitter, there’s not going to be any change to the processor or the RAM.

Luckily, for those users that specifically want a MacBook Pro and requires gobs and gobs of storage will certainly want to wait for this because new specifications reveal that future customers will be able to configure the notebook to feature up to 4TB of SSD storage. By contrast, this is still lower than the maxed-out 16-inch MacBook Pro in terms of storage, as users can configure the larger machine to sport up to 8TB of storage.
If you head over to Apple’s website, the current 13-inch MacBook Pro can be configured up to 2TB of storage space, so bumping it up to 4TB for the updated model will be seen as a welcome upgrade for a few users, but Apple will also be charging a premium for this. Also, the 28W Intel part seems like an interesting choice, assuming Apple decides to pick it for this model. Assuming the company doesn’t compromise on the thermal design of the notebook, the Core i7-1068NG7 can run at 4.10GHz for short periods, but this is probably for single-core tasks.
For multi-core-related tasks, these alleged 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro specs look very promising and seeing as how every other MacBook in Apple’s lineup has been updated with the new scissor-switch mechanism, it’s only a matter of time before the company unveils an updated 13-inch version. If we’re lucky, the display size will be upgraded to 14.1 inches too, as reported earlier, so users will have a little more screen real estate to play around with.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Refreshed 13-inch MacBook Pro may have 4TB storage option, 32GB memory</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple's rumored refresh of the 13-inch MacBook Pro could have more than just a larger display, with the suggestion that Apple may be increasing the storage capacity for the model from 2 terabytes to a 4-terabyte option, as well as more memory.
There is some speculation that Apple will be bringing out a refreshed 13-inch MacBook Pro in the near future, with some suggesting it could take place sometime in May. Current rumors largely focus on the display being upgraded to 14 inches, but it is thought Apple is testing other changes it could be including in the reworked model. Twitter account @_rogame posted on Twitter on Wednesday that there is a new configuration of the 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro, equipped with a Core i7-1068NG7 quad-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz and a boost that could reach 4.1GHz. As part of the same tweet, spotted by iMore, the model is also being tested with 32 gigabytes of RAM and a 4-terabyte SSD. The account previously claimed in February that Apple was trialling a model with the same processor and RAM, offering a supposed specifications list screenshot at the time. The processor in question is one from Intel's 10th-generation Ice Lake chip range, the same generation as used in the MacBook Air refresh from March.
The RAM figure of 32 gigabytes would be an improvement from the existing upper limit of 16 gigabytes offered on the 13-inch model. It is plausible that Apple will offer higher memory capacities on the 13-inch model, as the 16-inch MacBook Pro is available with up to 64 gigabytes. It is also similarly feasible for Apple to offer higher storage capacities for the model, higher than the 1TB maximum option currently available to purchase. Again, the 16-inch mode has 2TB, 4TB, and 8TB SSD options, so it seems probable the 13-inch model will follow with a similar storage range. Other changes have been suggested for the model, including investor notes by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo speculating the use of a 14.1-inch Mini LED display, along with the use of the new scissor-switch keyboard mechanism.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reliance Jio’s Covid-19 tracker tool user data exposed online due to a security lapse: Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A security lapse in Reliance Jio’s Covid-19 self checker tool has led to one of the tool’s core database being exposed to the internet without a password, TechCrunch reported on Sunday.
The security issue was first detected by cybersecurity researcher Anurag Sen who found the database on May 1, right after it was first exposed, the report said. After TechCrunch notified the company, Jio immediately pulled the system offline. There is no specification as to how many people have accessed the database before the system was taken offline.
“The logging server was for monitoring performance of our website, intended for the limited purpose of people doing a self-check to see if they have any COVID-19 symptoms,” said Jio spokesperson Tushar Pania as quoted by TechCrunch.
Reliance Jio had rolled out the online tool back in March. The self-checker is meant to help people self-assess their symptoms in order to map their risk of contracting Covid-19.
The self-test is a list of questions at the end of which the AI-driven tool figures out the test taker’s risk level, from high to low.
The questionnaire begins with basic questions, including who the test is for and the age and gender of the person. It then asks the respondent about their health conditions, their travel history apart from if the user or their family have come in contact with a Covid-positive person.
The database that was accessed by Sen contained millions of logs and records starting April 17 till the time that it was pulled offline.
As mentioned by Pania the server was meant to monitor the website performance and contained a running log of website errors and other system messages. However, it also contained a database of a huge number of user data who had taken the self-test. The data also led back to who the test was taken for, information about the user’s browser version and their operating system.
It also had the individual records of users who had signed up on the website to create a profile which allowed them to update their symptoms over time. The database contained the user’s answers to each question.
According to the report, certain records also contained a user’s precise geolocation if the user allowed the symptom checker access to their browser or phone’s location data. TechCrunch was able to identify user’s homes using the location data found.
Majority of the location data is clustered around cities such as Mumbai and Pune. However, data of users in locations such as the United Kingdom and North America were also found.
The company has not yet specified if it will inform users of the symptom tracker about the security lapse.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Database containing results of Reliance Jio’s Covid-19 checker tool exposed online</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reliance Jio launched its Covid-19 symptom checker tool back in March this year to help its users identify if they have been infected with the virus. Now, a report says that one of the databases containing the results of users’ Covid-19 tests may have been exposed online without a password.
According to a report by TechCrunch, a security lapse in one of the tool’s core databases exposed the users’ test results on the internet without a password. The security lapse was first detected by security researcher Anurag Sen on May 1, who then contacted the publication about the flaw. Reliance Jio took its database offline soon after it was informed about the bug.
The leaked database, as per the report, contains millions of logs between April 17 till the time the database was taken offline. It contained details of who took the test (self or a relative with their age and gender) and records of people who signed up to create a profile. These records contain answers to all the questions asked by the tool, which includes users’ symptoms, what health conditions they may have and who they have been in contact with.
In some cases, the record also showed users’ precise location with most of them being in cities like Mumbai and Pune. Some records also belonged to people in North America and the United Kingdom.
Reliance Jio has taken the database offline.
“We have taken immediate action...The logging server was for monitoring performance of our website, intended for the limited purpose of people doing a self-check to see if they have any COVID-19 symptoms,” a Reliance Jio spokesperson said in a statement to the publication.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Energy Star confirms Core i7-1065G7 and 32 GB of RAM for the Surface Book 3 but no Ryzen 4000 Renoir options; third Surface Go 2 SKU confirmed too</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Featuring a Core i7-1065G7 and 32 GB of RAM, the Surface Book 3 SKUs that have flown through Energy Star are sizeable upgrades over their predecessors. It looks increasingly unlikely that there will be any Ryzen 4000 Renoir options, though. Energy Star has confirmed the existence of a third Surface Go 2 SKU, too.
The Surface Book 3 has reared its head again, this time at Energy Star. Listed along with the Surface Go 2 in recent certification publications, Microsoft is expected to unveil new Surface hardware this month.
While the Surface Book 3 has been nailed on as one of the devices to be unveiled by Microsoft this spring, there has been plenty of talk about what processors it will feature. Energy Star has offered some clarification on this, and it is not good news for AMD and Renoir fans.
In short, it is looking unlikely that Microsoft will release a Ryzen 4000 version of the Surface Book 3. If Microsoft had planned to do so, then it would have assigned this model another SKU, as it has with the AMD version of the Surface Laptop 3 15. As it stands, Microsoft has only registered Intel SKUs of the Surface Book 3. Hence, unless Energy Star publishes another Surface Book SKU in the coming days, we doubt that Microsoft will release an AMD-powered Surface Book 3. 
Contrary to previous rumours, the two Energy Star listings suggest that Microsoft has developed Ice Lake-U versions of the Surface Book 3. Energy Star reports that both the 13.5-inch and 15-inch models have been tested running a quad-core Core i7 processor with a 1.3 GHz base clock.
Energy Star accurately reports base clocks, so these three elements are enough to deduce what processor is powering these Surface Book 3 units. Reasonably, only the Core i7-1065G7 matches the description offered by Energy Star, which also confirms that Ice Lake-U processor are headed to the Surface Book 3.
Do not rule out Microsoft releasing Comet Lake-U variants too, though. Microsoft would not need to assign another SKU for a Comet Lake-U Surface Book 3, in the same way it did not with 7th and 8th generation Intel Core versions of the Surface Book 2.
Energy Star confirms that the Surface Book 3 will be configurable with up to 32 GB of RAM, an upgrade over the Surface Book 2. Additionally, the listings make plain that the C3K1900 and C3K1899 at the FCC are the Surface Book 3 13 and Surface Book 3 15, respectively. Incidentally, the FCC has confirmed that at least the 13.5-inch model will be fitted with an Intel AX201D2W Wi-Fi 6 modem.
Energy Star also offered assurances that the Surface Go 2 will be configurable with up to a Core m3-8100Y and 8 GB of RAM. The listing references model numbers 1926 and 1927, on which we have previously reported.
Interestingly, the listing mentions model 1901, listed as the C3K1901 at the FCC. Confirmed to be featuring an Intel AX200 Wi-Fi modem, this is the first we have heard of a third Surface Go 2 SKU. Energy Star and the FCC offer limited details about the device too, besides it including an Intel modem. Regardless, the release of the Surface Go 2 and Surface Book 3 should only be a few weeks away now, although Microsoft is yet to confirm a date.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Surface Book 3 appears on Energy Star certifications site, confirming rumored specs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like Microsoft is quite close to releasing Surface Book 3 and while cannot confirm exactly when it will hit the market, both the 13-inch and the 15-inch model appeared in Energy Star certifications site, hinting that the 3rd Gen. Surface Book may finally be launched in a few weeks. Prior to this, Surface Book 3 passed FCC — the FCC listing suggested support for WiFi 6.
Apart from hinting that the release date is near, the Surface Book 3 listing on the Energy Star certifications site suggests that the Surface Book 3 will be available come with i7 processor and 32GB of RAM, which goes in line with what we reported earlier. Beyond this, we didn’t get any new information about Book 3 from the listing.
From what we’ve heard from reliable sources, the third Gen. Surface Book will be available in two different CPU options, Intel Core i5-10210U and the Intel Core i7-10510U, like its predecessors. The pricing of the 3rd Gen. Surface Book lineup is likely to start at 1000 Euros and may go up to 4000 Euros for the top-end model.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Pixel 4a's full camera specs are allegedly detailed in a new leak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Cuban vlogger TecnoLike Plus has already purported to have reviewed the Google Pixel 4a's cameras well ahead of its launch. Now, the same source has leaked this phone's relevant specs in more detail. It seems the phone has the same Sony IMX shooters as some older Pixels on its front and back.
The Pixel 4a's cameras have been leaked by TecnoLike Plus (aka Julio Lusson) to some degree already. Now, it is claimed that he has sent this upcoming budget-Google phone's full camera specs to the XDA. It comes in the form of Device Info HW and DevCheck app read-outs, allegedly associated with this device.
Their results may come as little enough of a surprise for in-depth Pixel followers. They apparently show that the 4a has an 8MP Sony IMX355 for a front camera, a sensor with an f/2.0 lens and pixels of 1.14 microns in size. Its single main shooter is a 12.2MP f/1.73 Sony IMX363 with 1.4 micron pixels. If they sound familiar, this is because they have also featured in the Pixel 3/3a and 4 respectively.
Despite this apparent recycling of tech at Google, this makes for good news for smartphone photography enthusiasts without quite all of the money. This new leak, should it prove accurate, points to the same shooting power so lauded in the 3 and 4 series. For example, they indicate that the Pixel 4a will be able to do effective portrait shots despite using only 1 sensor at a time.
In addition, XDA contributors point out that the 3a's successor may also deliver effective Super Res Zoom, Night Sight and dynamic range. However, these new camera samples also show it may suffer in terms of exposure in some shots.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here are the Google Pixel 4a, OnePlus Z and HTC Desire 20 Pro leaks from this past week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Images, renders and videos of upcoming smartphones are continually leaking.
All of these leaks are often difficult to follow, so we’ve compiled a list of this past week’s hottest rumours. This week, we’re taking a look at smartphone leaks that occurred from April 25th to May 1st.
It’s been a while since I included HTC in this list.
A render of the Desire 20 Pro, codenamed ‘Bayamo,’ has appeared online. The leaked render showcases that the smartphone features a hole-punch camera in the top right corner and four rear-facing camera sensors. Details about these cameras are not yet known.
For more on the HTC Desire 20 Pro leak, click here.
A leaked render of an apparent Samsung phone with a pop-up selfie camera has surfaced online.
The leak showcases a pop-up selfie shooter similar to the OnePlus 7 Pro’s. By the looks of the phone, it’ll likely fall into Samsung’s line of mid-range handsets and probably at the lower end of it. Alongside the pop-up camera, the device also features a rear-facing fingerprint scanner and a sizable bottom bezel.
For more on the pop-up camera Samsung leak, click here.
The leaker behind this rumour says that internal documents indicate carriers will start selling the Pixel 4a on May 22nd. This seems likely as Google was expected to reveal the Pixel 4a at I/O.

OnePlus is expected to release the OnePlus Z in June this year. Though the company recently revealed the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro, the mysterious OP8 Lite never appeared. Now it seems the company will launch it as the OPZ. Leaks indicate the phone will sport a flat-screen, possibly last year’s camera tech, and a mid-range MediaTek Dimensity 1000 processor.
For more on the OnePlus Z, click here.
Another leak suggests that the OnePlus Z might have a little bit more in its trunk. This rumour indicates the OnePlus Z will sport Qualcomm’s upper mid-range processor, the Snapdragon 765.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You've got a lot going on, and we're here to help make things a little easier for you. If you want to get a speedy workout in but have no idea where to start, we recommend this quick, total-body strength workout. This workout requires dumbbells, but if you don't have any, use an alternative like water bottles, textbooks, or just use your bodyweight.
Equipment needed: a set of medium-weight dumbbells. If you aren't sure how to choose your weights, use this simple guide. Before getting started, make sure you warm up to prevent injury and to maximize your workout — try this dynamic warmup.
This workout should be performed as a circuit; complete one set of each exercise taking little to no rest in between each move. Once you've completed a round of all the exercises, rest one to two minutes. Complete a total of three rounds. Don't forget to cool down and stretch once you're done.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Get A Great Cardio Workout At Home With This 6-Move Routine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Most of us around the world are staying home right now, which means we're also moving less than ever. Unless you're going for socially distanced runs, you're probably not doing a ton of cardio these days. But it's just as important now (if not more so) to regularly rev your heart rate. Cardio workouts can help manage stress and anxiety, increase concentration, and even positively affect our moods. 
That's why I put together this quick cardio workout you can do at home. You don't need any equipment, although it might be helpful to grab a mat. Challenge yourself to focus on speed while maintaining good form, to get the most out of every rep.
Time: 10 to 15 minutesEquipment: MatInstructions: Complete the indicated number of reps for each move. Do each move for three to four rounds, resting up to a minute in between each set. Then continue to the next exercise.
How to: Start by standing with both feet on the ground, hands at your sides. Drive one knee toward your chest as high as you can. Immediately bring it to the ground and repeat with your other knee. That's one rep. Complete 50.
Note: Go as fast as you can. You should feel like you're sprinting in place.
How to: Stand with your feet about hip-width apart. Pull your shoulders back, engage your core, sit your hips back, and lower into a deep squat.
Return to standing while simultaneously raising one knee toward your elbow on your same side. Lower into a squat and repeat on the opposite side. That's one rep. Complete 5.
How to: Lie on your back with your legs straight, placing palms down, with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Keeping your core tight, lift your legs off of the floor while keeping your knees as straight as possible and your toes pointed. Just before your legs reach vertical, lift your lower back off the floor into an extended candlestick position.
Lower down, then immediately rock onto your feet and set your palms flat on the floor in front of you. Jump your feet back, then do a pushup. Jump forward then jump up straight in the air, adding a clap at the top. That's one rep. Complete 10.
How to: From standing, jump or step down into a pushup position with your shoulders directly over your wrists and your arms close to your ribs. Keeping your core tight, lower your body into a pushup, with your gaze slightly in front of your hands.
At the top of your pushup, jump or step back up to standing, then immediately do a backward lunge on your right side. Repeat this sequence, this time lunging on your left side. That's one rep. Complete 10.
Beginner modification: Perform pushups with your hands on an elevated surface to make this exercise easier. 
How to: Start in a high plank position, with your core engaged. Bring one knee toward your chest, then repeat with the other knee so it feels like you're running in place. That's one rep. Complete 50.
How to: Lie on your back with your legs straight and arms reaching toward your knees. Pull your belly button toward your spine as you raise your arms and legs.
Tuck your knees toward your chest, pressing your hands forward. Return to the starting position. That's one rep. Complete 15.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quart is a new notification interface that will make non-jailbreakers jealous</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When compared with other smartphone operating systems, there’s no question that iOS leaves a lot to be desired in the notification department. Fortunately, those with jailbroken handsets no longer have to settle with what Apple provides out of the box.
Quart is a newly released jailbreak tweak by iOS developer LaughingQuoll and designer timeloop that replaces the lackluster native notification system on your pwned iPhone with one that will get you riled up every time you receive a text message or any other sort of notification.
In the screenshot examples above and below, you can see for yourself just how much more aesthetically pleasing Quart is when compared with the native notification system. The tweak primarily works its magic on the Lock screen, offering a slick new appearance for incoming notifications as well as the Lock screen’s date and time display. Just to the right of that, Quart summarizes the number of missed notifications you have.
As you’ve probably noticed, Quart supports the ability to clear all missed notifications in one fell swoop by pulling down on them. The tweak also works its magic on the Lock screen’s Now Playing media player, helping it to confirm with the new look and feel of your notification banners.
In addition to making the Lock screen look nicer, Quart also redesigns notification banners everywhere else. For example, if you receive a text message while perusing the Home screen or while using an app, the tweak displays a non-intrusive notification bubble at the top of your display that you can interact with if you so choose to reply:
It should be mentioned that Quart is fully customizable. Upon installing the tweak, users will find a dedicated preference pane in the Settings app for configuring their settings how they like:
Here, you can:
A Respring button is provided at the bottom of the preference pane to save any changes you make on demand.
Those who follow the developers on Twitter would know that Quart has been under development for quite some time, but it was only made available to the general public starting this weekend. Quart is a slick replacement for the notification system that most of us are used to, and those interested in trying it can purchase it for $1.99 from the Packix repository via your preferred package manager (or just $0.99 for Patreon subscribers). The tweak supports jailbroken iOS 12 and 13 devices.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to enable VoLTE on a OnePlus phone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VoLTE isn't particularly new, but it's a luxury feature nonetheless. Otherwise known as voice-over-LTE, this tech allows you to use your data connnection to make dramatically clearer, crisper-sounding voice calls instead of the garbled mess we're all used to. Just about every manufacturer and carrier supports VoLTE these days, and OnePlus is no exception — here's how to enable it.
Enabling VoLTE on a OnePlus phone is as simple as jumping into the Settings app and hitting a switch. Nearly every OnePlus phone is compatible with VoLTE (especially if your phone was released in the last couple of years), but your carrier might also play a part in whether or not you'll be able to use it. The vast majority of carriers support VoLTE, but you should check with your particular carrier if the following steps don't work for you.
Once enabled, you should begin to notice an immediate and significant improvement in call quality. Not only will callers on the other end of the line sound more clear, you'll sound better to them as well. As an added perk, most carriers count VoLTE talk time against your minutes rather than your data plan, just like regular calls, meaning even if you're on a plan with a limited data allowance, you'll be able to place calls over VoLTE all day long.
OnePlus's first full-blown flagship phone
From water resistance to wireless charging, 5G support, and three excellent cameras, the OnePlus 8 Pro offers everything you'd expect of a modern flagship. That includes the price, but it's well worth it for anyone after one of the best Android experiences around.
Last year's budget champ is still a great value today
The OnePlus 7T is still an incredible phone six months after its release, thanks to powerful specs and regular software updates. It lacks the OnePlus 8 Pro's luxuries like water resistance and wireless charging, but for nearly half the price, it's easy to recommend.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Huawei to replace Windows 10 with HarmonyOS 2.0 in its PCs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last year, the US Department of Commerce blacklisted Huawei. After that, the company announced the development of its OS – HarmonyOS. Now, we know that Huawei plans to release computers with its own operating system.
According to Huaweicentral, referring to an insider post in the Chinese social network Weibo, computers with HarmonyOS 2.0 can enter the company’s home market. Devices will also run on Kunpeng processors.
An insider reports that several provinces, cities, and regions are already helping Huawei to set up PC supply chains.
Recall that Huawei already reported that HarmonyOS will be a cross-platform solution. This means that the operating system can be flexibly deployed on different devices including smartwatches, personal computers, cars, and others.
Despite the problems associated with the inability to work with Google, Huawei continues to launch new flagship smartphones with Android OS and Huawei mobile services instead of Google mobile services. The company keeps developing its own AppGallery application store and the HarmonyOS operating system, while not forgetting to release full-fledged flagships. But there are times when its representatives are “a little” odd – for example, the head of Huawei said that the company will need “no more” 300 years to catch up with Google and Apple.
“Sales of devices on Android and Apple operating systems in the world are huge, and Huawei is late. It’s hard for consumers to accept other operating systems. Thus, the Huawei OS can take a long time to surpass Android and Apple, but no more than 300 years, ” said the CEO of the company Ren Zhengfei in an interview with Dragon Magazine.
These statements are frustrating for the employees and fans of the giant company. And it is more strange that it comes from the founder of the company.
According to Richard Yu, the CEO of Huawei consumer business. HMS (Huawei mobile services) currently is in more than 170 countries and regions. With more than 400 million monthly active users and more than 1.3 million developers and partners. It is already second only to Google Android and Apple iOS, ranking the top three globally.
At present, Google Play has more than 2.1 million apps, while Huawei AppGalery currently has only 55,000 apps. In the short term, GMS’s leading position is undoubtedly difficult to shake, let alone replace Android with Hongmeng OS.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Incoming: Huawei PCs powered by Kunpeng Processors and HarmonyOS 2.0</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to a popular Chinese tipster, Huawei is set to enter PC industry with products powered by the company’s own HiSilicon Kunpeng processors. The most interesting thing is they will run the newly announced HamrmonyOS.
As of now, the Chinese tech giant’s proprietary OS codenamed HongMeng is only found on a few Honor as well as Huawei-branded smart TVs. But with the release of HarmonyOS 2.0, we might see it on PCs.
The tipster alleged these PCs to be powered by Kunpeng processors. He also revealed several Chinese provinces, cities, and regions are cooperating with the homegrown company to build its PC industry supply chain.
Huawei unveiled HarmonyOS at Huawei Developer Conference (HDC) 2019. At the event, the company also shared a roadmap, which mentioned the version 2.0 to be released in 2020 with support for PC, cars, and smart wearables.
So it is all happening as per the plan disclosed by the firm last year. We can expect the announcement of HarmonyOS 2.0 to take place at Huawei Developer Conference 2020 later this year.
Further, Kunpeng processors are not new as the company is already supplying them to its enterprise customers for computing solutions. In 2019, Huawei also announced its first desktop motherboard based on Kunpeng 920 processor with support for all necessary hardware. However, this motherboard is not available for consumers yet. 
The upcoming Huawei PCs will be either powered by this motherboard or the company will announce something new at HDC 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fewer than 2% of Steam users own VR headsets, despite surge that followed Half-Life: Alyx</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just 1.9 percent of Steam users own VR headsets.
This statistic was revealed by Valve following a recent hardware survey (via Road to VR) – the first survey of this kind since the March release of its flagship VR title Half-Life: Alyx.
This statistic represents the number of headsets connected to Steam over a particular month – which means, while it’s the closest we have to data on active VR users, it does not account for headsets which were connected but not actively used.
Even so, the numbers are fascinating. April 2020 saw a surge in VR users, nearly three times the prior record reached in the winter of 2019. Based on its own estimates, Road to VR reports that 950,000 additional VR headsets connected during this period, totalling an estimated 2.7 million headsets.
As we reported in January, the Index VR headset was already sold out in-stores and online. While Index isn’t the only VR headset you can use to play Half-Life: Alyx – Valve designed the game to work with a wide range of headsets – the increased demand was most likely driven squarely by the game.
Half-Life: Alyx was a critical hit when it lauched two months ago, receiving a 5 out of 5 review from VG247.”One of the reasons Valve never counted to three and gave us a proper sequel is the expectation that comes with it,” Kirk wrote of the franchise. “The series’ core ideas have been refined and polished, and believable physics are no longer such a novelty in video games. Where is left for Half-Life to innovate? It turns out Valve just needed new tech. It just needed VR.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Half-Life: Alyx spurred a massive jump in VR headset ownership on Steam</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the introduction to our Half-Life: Alyx review, Dustin observed that the game was “shouldering the hopes of the virtual reality industry.” The first post-Alyx Steam Hardware Survey results are in, and it appears as though Alyx has come through: by one estimate, a whopping 950,000 new headsets were connected to Steam in the month after Alyx launched.
As Road to VR points out, that’s the biggest single-month increase ever, more than triple the previous record set over the December-January holiday season. April’s Steam Hardware Survey shows 1.91% of Steam users had a VR headset of some kind connected to their PC – making VR twice as popular on Steam as Linux with about half the number of users who are on MacOS.
It’s worth noting that Steam’s reported numbers in the hardware survey are a bit fuzzy. First, the survey reports ‘monthly connected headsets,’ which only means that a headset was connected while a user was logged into Steam – it doesn’t say whether the headset was actually used. Second, the numbers are reported as a share of Steam’s overall user population rather than in raw totals, so we don’t have a firm figure on exactly how many Steam users own VR headsets.
Helpfully, Road to VR has an in-house algorithm that computes estimates based on available information, and they say the model suggests about 950,000 more monthly connected VR headsets in April over March, which makes for about 2.7 million headsets in the Steam ecosystem.
The survey also shows that Valve’s own share of the VR market has increased, making it the third biggest VR hardware manufacturer on Steam after Oculus and HTC just a year after the launch of the Valve Index.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Android TV devices can now be added to speaker groups in the Google Home app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Google Cast protocol is one of Google’s most useful services as it enables you to quickly play music, videos, podcasts, and more on your compatible smart speaker, smart display, TV, and more devices after finding the content you want to play on your Android device. Android TV devices are compatible with Google Cast, and now you can add them to speaker groups in the Google Home app.
Last night, Twitter user @androidtv_rumor noticed (via 9to5Google) that he was able to add his NVIDIA SHIELD TV to a speaker group that includes a Google Nest Hub smart display and Google Home Mini smart speaker. He says that this feature was enabled via an update to version 1.47.207274 for the pre-installed “Chromecast built-in” app. Another Twitter user confirmed that they were able to add their SHIELD TV to a speaker group after receiving this update.
Creating a speaker group is a handy feature in the Google Home app as it allows you to cast media to multiple Google Cast devices simultaneously. The ability to add Google Cast devices to speaker groups was initially only available for Google Home smart speakers, Chromecast Audio devices, and other Google Cast-enabled speakers. In November of 2018, Google rolled out the ability to add Chromecasts to speaker groups in the Google Home app. Android TV devices have built-in Google Cast functionality but only now are they getting the ability to be added to speaker groups.
In case you haven’t received this update to the “Chromecast built-in” app yet, you can sign up for the beta program on the Google Play Store. Then, open up the Google Home app to see if you can add your Android TV device to a speaker group.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Android TV devices can now be added to Google Home speaker groups</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the best features of Google’s Assistant ecosystem is the ability to create speaker groups that play music throughout your entire home. Now, Google is making it possible to add Android TV devices to a speaker group.
Through an update to the Chromecast Built-in app, Google has apparently enabled all Android TV devices to work with speaker groups. Most users who have been able to get this working have been on Nvidia Shield TV models and I was able to confirm it on my unit too.
I tried to get things running on Google’s ADT-3 developer device as well, but I’ve been unable to get the Chromecast built-in app to update even with a sideloaded APK. On an AirTV Mini device, the app did install and I was able to get it to appear in the Google Home app after a reboot.
Pointed out by @AndroidTV_rumoron Twitter, an easy way to get in on this updated version is to join the Chromecast Built-in beta on the Play Store. Within a little while, that should push the updated version to your device.
Why has Google enabled this? Well for one, it’s been a glaring omission to the speaker group feature for a while — why shouldn’t Android TV devices work with this? The timing, however, tells me that Google has enabled this feature now in preparation for the second-gen Chromecast Ultra we exclusively reported on earlier this year. The original Chromecast Ultra supports speaker groups, so not enabling that on Android TV would mean the second-gen wouldn’t have feature parity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple’s iPhone 12 could be $50 cheaper than the iPhone 11</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple could launch the iPhone 12 at a lower price when the device hits retail shelves later this year.  The information comes from Jon Prosser of the YouTube channel Front Page Tech. Prosser says his sources said that the iPhone 12 would cost $650, a $50 cheaper than the iPhone 11.
It’s the same strategy Apple used for the iPhone 11. The handset has a starting price of $699 for the 64GB storage model which is $50 cheaper than the iPhone XR which was launched in 2018. If the iPhone 12 ends up being $50 cheaper than the iPhone 11, it would help Apple to create an even more affordable flagship device that will appeal to consumers who don’t want to spend money on the company’s top-end models. Plus, this is the time period many would hesitate in spending $1000 on a flagship Apple device due to an uncertain environment.
On many levels, the iPhone 12 at $649 will be a breakthrough. The iPhone 12 will be the first “affordable flagship iPhone” to come with an OLED display. Right now, the OLED displays are limited to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Meanwhile, the iPhone 11 comes with a regular LCD display. But there is a $300 gap between the base model of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro.
Prosser believes Apple will launch four models of the iPhone 12 lineup: a 5.4-inch model that would cost $650, a 6.1-inch version priced at $750, and two iPhone 12 Pro models at 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches. The latter two models are expected to cost $1000 and $1100 respectively. That would be a significant departure from Apple’s current approach of launching three iPhones a year. All four iPhones will come with 5G and OLED screens.
Rumour has it that this year’s iPhone will be radically different from the previous generation iPhones. The phones may have a smaller notch and rounded corners like the iPhone 5.

Apple is scheduled to launch new iPhones in September, though the novel coronaviruspandemic could delay the iPhone 12 lineup. Apple recently launched the iPhone SE, a cheaper iPhone for $399. The new iPhone SE has the same A13 chipset found inside the iPhone 11, but the design is similar to the 2017’s iPhone 8.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple iPhone 12: Price Leaked! Everything You Need To Know</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">iPhone 12 is expected to launch this year. The launch of the series is delayed, and the devices could be on track for the launch. As per the news, a fresh leak has come out which shows the iPhone 12 series models price, and it could do with a premium for 5G connectivity. As per the leak, the 5G iPhone models will be costlier than the previous generation models.
A famous tipster Jon Prosser said that the iPhone SE launch date the iPhone 12 series price will start from $649. Earlier few leaks said there can be four iPhone models under the 5G series, and the 5.4 inches iPhone 12 price will be $649, 6.1-inch iPhone 12 price will start from $749 and 6.1-inch iPhone 12 Pro will have a price tag of $999. And at last, the top-end iPhone 12 Pro Max with 6.7-inch will have a price of $1099.
However, it is too early to guess the prices of iPhone 12 series, but the tipster has done it. If the prices by the leaks are true, then the iPhone 12 will not be much expensive. The two low-end iPhone 12 models will be 5G, but the price will be under $800.
The Indian pricing for the models will not be a minor currency translation as Apple sees the dollar conversion differently. Apart from that, Apple needs to pay taxes (customs duty and GST) to sell its iPhone models in India.
The premium pricing for the iPhone models stops customers to buy from Apple. So, Apple has decided to keep the prices down, at least for its low-tier models. However, Apple has divided iPhone models to offer an affordable device to suit in other countries like India.
Tipster Prosser has revealed some extra information about the iPhone 12 series and 5G support which could be available on all the models. The 5.4-inch iPhone 12 which has a codenamed D52G which will have an OLED display, two rear cameras, and a 5G support.
The 6.1-inch iPhone 12 with codenamed D53G which has OLED display, two cameras, and 5G support. Moreover, iPhone 12 Pro with codenamed D53P will have 6.1-inch OLED display, three rear cameras, a LiDAR sensor, and it has support for 5G. Finally, the iPhone 12 Pro Max with codenamed D54P will have 6.7-inch OLED display with three cameras, a LiDAR sensor and supports 5G support.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Another day, another Meizu 17 teaser poster. Meizu has confirmed that its upcoming flagship has a punch-hole display. The Weibo post also revealed the supplier of the display.
The Meizu 17 will have its punch-hole at the top right corner of the display and Meizu says it is a fully-custom Samsung Super AMOLED display. Based on this, we expect the Meizu 17 to be able to measure up to other flagships such as the OnePlus 8 series in terms of display quality. It has already been confirmed that the display has a 90Hz refresh rate.
Press renders have depicted the punch hole of the Meizu 17 as being pretty small in size, and we can’t wait to see if it is true.
The phone will have a Snapdragon 865 processor, UFS 3.1 storage, 64MP quad rear cameras, stereo speakers, 30W fast charging support, and Wi-Fi 6. It is scheduled to launch on Friday, May 8.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About two weeks ago, Huami officially confirmed that the Xiaomi Mi Band 5 will be available later this year. Recall that the Xiaomi Mi Band series is jointly developed by Xiaomi and Huami. An alleged real image of the Xiaomi Mi Band 5recently hit the web.
From the images, the Mi Band 5 will come with a substantial upgrade relative to its predecessor. It has evolved from the previous square screen to a brand-new oval punch-hole display. The punch-hole could be a placement for a camera (perhaps?) at the bottom of the screen. However, it seems to be too large considering the small display, so it could really be something else or perhaps a totally fake set of photos. The image shows that the alleged Band 5 comes with a grey strap. However, we do not expect this colour to be the only option.
According to reports, the Band 5 outside China will support NFC. If this pulls through, this will be the first Xiaomi band to support NFC outside China. Furthermore, information from TizenHelp, claims that the Xiaomi Mi Band 5 will come with a 1.2-inch display. This is larger than the 0.95-inch AMOLED screen on its predecessor. This means that the band 5 details will be more visible and there will be more space for icons. Despite the larger display, this device will be lighter and with more contrast. Thus, reading from the band in sunlight will be easier.
As of now, Xiaomi NFC smart bands are only active in China. Nevertheless, it appears that the Xiaomi Mi Band 5 NFC version will be active in the global market. This means that it will probably support Google Pay & other payment services. The Mi Band 5 NFC global version will support contactless payments, work pass and can be used as a bus card. These features are currently active in China. Xiaomi releases its Mi Band every year so we expect the Band 5 this year.
What do you think about the alleged leaked image of the Mi Band 5? Is it real or not? What about that black punch hole at the lower part of the display? Is it a fake or could it be the real thing? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Xiaomi launched the latest version of its Android skin, MIUI 12, last week. The company has already released multiple closed beta builds in China. Now, Xiaomi.EU has reworked on these China builds and has released beta builds for global users. 
Xiaomi’s latest and greatest MIUI generally sees the light of day first in China. The company then goes on to release several beta builds before a stable roll-out. The Chinese MIUI version supports only Mandarin and English languages. It also lacks Google apps and comes with Chinese bloatware that is really of no use elsewhere, globally.
Xiaomi’s EU team has given global users a chance to experience the new UI, by adding more languages to the build. It has also removed the Chinese bloatware and added Google apps so that users can enjoy the latest UI in their daily drivers. 
The latest build by Xiaomi EU is available for 28 devices as of now with more unlocked features hidden by Xiaomi, so that users can experience the new MIUI 12 features that include an improved Dark Mode 2.0, new layout changes, improved privacy(in partnership with MACE), a new Control Center and more.
Below is a chart released by Xiaomi EU that includes the list of supported devices for the latest MIUI 12 build:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Xiaomi.EU releases MIUI 12 builds for 20+ Xiaomi Mi and Redmi devices</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week, Xiaomi announced the latest version of its Android-based software for its Mi and Redmi smartphones—MIUI 12. The update adds a plethora of useful features as we noted in our hands-on. Xiaomi has started rolling out MIUI 12 closed beta builds for a handful of devices in China, but now there’s a better way to try the latest software features thanks to the Xiaomi.EU team.
Xiaomi’s MIUI China software releases aren’t intended to be used by global users. MIUI China only has Mandarin and English as languages, lacks Google apps, and comes with a bunch of Chinese services that aren’t of any use outside of the country. The team at Xiaomi.EU takes MIUI China and translates the strings to more languages, adds Google apps, and removes various Chinese services so global users can enjoy bleeding edge MIUI features. In addition, Xiaomi.EU also unlocks a bunch of features that Xiaomi restricts to certain device models or are otherwise hidden in MIUI. Their latest release is based on the Chinese MIUI 12 beta builds and is available on over 2 dozen Mi and Redmi smartphones.
Update to MIUI 12. You have to install this update MANUALLY – updater wouldn’t work.

The initial list of 28 Xiaomi Mi and Redmi devices that Xiaomi.EU based on MIUI 12 supports includes the following:
The team dropped support for the Redmi Note 8 Pro due to issues with bricking that can’t be easily recovered from.
Here’s a chart that Xiaomi.EU published showing all the devices that are supported in this release, their Android OS versions, and whether rollback protection is enabled in this release.
You can download Xiaomi.EU’s MIUI 12 release on the team’s SourceForge or AndroidFileHost pages and read the release notes on the team’s official website.

To install the release, you’ll need to unlock the bootloader, flash TWRP, and then flash the ROM via TWRP.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus 5 and 5T Android 10-based OxygenOS Open Beta 2 is rolling out</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OnePlus easily is one of the companies with the best update tracking record nowadays. After having provided Android 10 updates for the OnePlus 7 and 6 series, the company is now moving its focus to the OnePlus 5 and 5T devices. One week ago, the company rolled out the first Android 10-based OyxgenOS 10 Open Beta for the duo of 2017 smartphones. The beta builds allow courageous users to test and provide feedback for developers.
The beta program usually take several rounds of Open Beta releases. However, it’s pretty understandable since the company is ensuring that all flaws are fixed before a wider rollout. Today OnePlus is rolling out the Open Beta 2 for the OnePlus 5 handsets. The new firmware basically brings several bug fixes for users running the previous beta. Moreover, it includes April 2020 security patch and improves general stability. Last but not least, the update promises to optimize the Multi-window mode.
Curiously, this update can’t be rolled out via OTA for users on Open Beta 1. Instead, users interested in the second build will need to flash it manually. Thankfully, the company states that users on Open Beta 1 or Android 9 Pie Stable release, won’t lose data by flashing this update. The same does not apply to users running Android 9 Pie-based Open Beta branch.

OnePlus 5T
The process of installation is quite simple. You can download the files provided below and use a File Manager of your choice to place the update zip in the root of internal storage. After that, you’ll just need to navigate to Settings >> System Updates and Click on the menu button located in the top-right corner. From there, select Local Upgrade and pick the update package you placed in the root directory. The update process will start and should take a few minutes, be sure to have at least 50% of battery.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week OnePlus finally delivered on a promise they made back in October of 2019: to update both the OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T to Android 10. As such, the first OxygenOS Open Beta based on Android 10 was released for both phones, allowing users to test drive the early software release and provide their feedback ahead of the official rollout.
It may take several rounds of Open Beta releases before we see the final update rolled out, but we’re making steady progress in that direction as the second OxygenOS Open Beta based on Android 10 has just been released for the OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 5T.
OnePlus 5 Forums ||| OnePlus 5T Forums
As expected, Open Beta 2 is mostly a bug-fixing update, and we’re not seeing any major shuffle in terms of new features or UI changes. The update optimizes the split-screen experience, improves general stability, fixes unspecified bugs, and also bumps the Android security patch level to April 2020.
The full changelog for Open Beta 2 is as below:
For some reason, this update will not be rolled out as OTA to Open Beta 1 users — as OnePlus previously mentioned in their blog post. Instead, users will have to install it manually. If you’re running the first Android 10-based Open Beta or the latest Android 9 Pie-based stable release, you should be able to install the new update without losing any user data. But if you’re coming from the last Android 9 Pie-based Open Beta, make sure to backup your data beforehand as flashing the Open Beta build will wipe everything.
To install Open Beta 2, download the update zip for your device from the below links:
Download OxygenOS Open Beta 2 for OnePlus 5
Download OxygenOS Open Beta 2 for OnePlus 5T
After downloading the update package, open a file manager of your choice and move the update zip from the Downloads folder to the root directory of the internal storage. Now navigate to Settings > System > System updates and click on the menu button located in the top right corner. From there, select Local Upgrade and select the update package placed in the root directory to begin the installation process.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GeForce Now gets 21 new titles and DLSS 2.0 support - Gizchina.com</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Back in the last year, we saw the big start of cloud gaming platforms. We have Microsoft’s Project Cloud, Google’s Stadia, and NVIDIA’s GeForce Now. The latter probably is one of the best services available since it has a huge portfolio with multi-platform support. The service started beta testing for Android last year and opened up for everyone in February. Last month, NVIDIA pledged to announce new games for GeForce NOW every week. Therefore, today the company is complying with this promise.
Back in April, the company rolled out several titles from XBOX Game Studios, Codemasters, Warner Bros, and Klei Entertainment and Ubisoft. Now, the company is rolling out more 21 titles including DLSS 2.0 support. This particular technology makes use of AI and RTX GPUs to enable “the next generation of performance and visuals”. As a result, we have improved deep learning neural networks that work to “boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images for games”.
The only single game supporting DLSS 2.0 right now is Control. However, the company will add support for MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries and Deliver US The Moon pretty soon. The complete list of games being added to GeForce NOW includes:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GeForce NOW, the cloud streaming service launched by NVIDIA earlier this year after years of beta, has been just updated to include support for Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) 2.0.
The first game to use it on GeForce NOW is Control, which already had real time ray tracing effects enabled. Deliver Us The Moon and MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries will get the same treatment soon, according to NVIDIA.
GeForce NOW Loses Games From Xbox Game Studios, Warner Bros, Codemasters and Klei
GeForce NOW was also updated to support 21 new games this week, including the newly released Moving Out and Snowrunner.
These are still mostly indie or double-A games, though. Many triple-A publishers have opted to remove themselves from GeForce NOW, including Activision Blizzard, 2K Games, Bethesda, Xbox Game Studios, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Codemasters, Klei. Electronic Arts never had its games on GeForce NOW to begin with, while Epic Games and Ubisoft have confirmed their unwavering support.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Game Tuner service is being terminated - Gizchina.com</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since games have become an important range in smartphones, many OEMs started to implement software tweaks to improve the gaming experience on their custom Android UI. As a result, many companies like Samsung can generate a solid experience for gamers without having to launch a dedicated gaming smartphone. Some offer advanced features like overclocking, while others are simple tweaks to improve the gaming experience. Samsung Game Tuner is the company’s solution for owners of the Galaxy lineup. In a sudden twist of fate, the company decided to shut down this service.
We can’t say that it is a surprising move. After all, the last update for the application cam in December 2018. Moreover, the company had already removed useful features like the FPS counter. The app itself still is available on Play Store and Galaxy Store. However, the Korean firm already initiated the retirement process by notifying Samsung Community members as well as blocking downloads since April 30th. Users that are on Android Oreo can keep using it. However, if you’re running One UI 2.0 or 2.1 you should opt for Game Plugins. That’ll be the spiritual successor to Game Tuner.
If you’re an avid user of Samsung Game Tuner features, you can opt for a third-party alternative like the Gaming Mode app. This app is supported by XDA-Developers and is available via Google Play Store.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Hardkernel ODROID-Go Advance is an inexpensive portable gaming device with a 3.5 inch display, an quad-core ARM Cortex-A35 processor, and Ubuntu Linux software. Designed for emulating classic game consoles, Hardkernel introduced the device late last year and began shipping it earlier this year.
Now the company is preparing to launch a new batch, and it includes a number of hardware updates.
According to a post in the ODROID forum, the new model should begin shipping on May 25th, and it’ll include the following updates:
Both of those colors will be made with transparent resins, allowing you to view status LEDs through the case. But the new black model is more opaque than the see-through Clear White model that had been the only option up until now.
Hardkernel is also planning to update the operating system with a new OS image based on Ubuntu 20.04 by mid-May, but that software should also be compatible with the original ODROID-Go Advance, so it’s not a feature that will be unique to the new hardware.
The updated version of its handheld game console is called the ODROID-Go Advance Black Edition, or OGA-BE. It’ll sell for $59, which is $4 more than the original model.
Other key ODROID-Go Advance features will remain unchanged, so the new model will still have a Rockchip RK3326 processor, a 480 x 320 pixel LCD display, 1GB of RAM, 16MB of SPI flash storage and a micorSD card reader, and a 3,000 mAh battery.
The handheld game console measures 6.1″ x 2.8″ x 0,8″ and weighs six ounces.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meizu 17 teaser reveals haptic mEngine 3.0 - Gizchina.com</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After a long period without much “relevant” launches, Meizu is gearing to unveil a new smartphone series made of some of the most ambitious handsets for a long time. The new Meizu 17 series may be composed of a vanilla variant, a Meizu 17 Pro and Meizu 17T. During the past few weeks, several leaks have been taking the headlines along with the company’s own teasers.
Today, the company is once again using its Weibo account to tease one of the features coming with the highly-anticipated flagship. Apart from the camera, display, and chipsets, the new handsets will also include a new feature dubbed haptic engine 3.0. According to the Weibo post, it’s a new “engine 3.0 horizontal linear motor” while it’s hard to digest what this really means, it’s easy to assume that the company is teasing a new precise and powerful haptic vibration.
In the past, decent haptic feedback was something exclusive to the high-end models. However, it has been reaching more affordable handsets in the last two or so years. As the new feature suggests, Meizu is ready to jump in this trend with the Meizu 17 series. The handset is gearing up to be a solid offering with bezel-less 90Hz display, Quad-Camera setup, Fast-charging support, and powerful battery.
Unfortunately, we’re yet to see if this handset will be exclusive for the Chinese market. After all the company has been a little shy with Global releases. Meizu was once one of the most relevant Chinese players but lost space with the intense competition. The lack of proper software support also enraged users. Let’s see if the new 5G smartphone will be enough to reconquer the company’s fanbase.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Week 18 in review:Several new Xiaomi and Redmi smartphones, MIUI 12 is official</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The last few days of April brought several new phones, most of them coming from one company - Xiaomi. It introduced two new additions to its Mi brand and another one from the Redmi family, while another was finally launched on the global scene.
The Xiaomi Mi 10 Youth was revealed in China with a periscope camera and 5x optical zoom, making it the first device by the company with the feature. Later through a Qualcomm press message, we learned its name will actually be Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite Zoom on the global scene.
Alongside it, the company unveiled MIUI 12, which will power most of the company's phones in the second half of the year.
The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Lite is another smartphone that saw the light of day - it has four cameras, one of them being 64 MP, neat OLED display and a low price tag of €349 or €399 - depending on the storage that you want to accompany the 6 GB RAM.
The iPhone 12 rumors are starting to intensify - this week we heard the lineup will include four phones and all of them will have 5G support. More excitingly, a rumor suggested that this won't lead to higher prices as was the case with some Android competitors.
LG revealed its Velvet phone will have a 48 MP main camera, a Snapdragon 765G chipset, and an OLED screen. The phone will be all about functionality and looks, and we hope this will try to pull the Korean company out of the pit its mobile division has fallen in.

Beta testing is already available for Chinese users, while the stable build is expected in June.

This is the first Xiaomi phone with such a camera.

The OnePlus 8 duo was unveiled in mid-April, but the Z - the "lite" model - was delayed.

Meanwhile, Sony Mobile online stores in Europe have closed, instead the official site redirects you to local retailers.

The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Lite is looking like a solid package for its €350 starting price.

It will have a similar front panel, but only four shooters on the back.

The A13 remaster of the iPhone 8 is here.

Eye AF for humans and animals, 20fps continuous shooting with AE/AF enabled and a ZEISS lens with T* coating are just the tip of the iceberg.

The stable build will begin rolling out around the end of June for Chinese users.

It's a supper aggressive price, but the 108MP sensor is gone. 

The pricing of the small iPhone 12 looks pretty good.

The pop-up selfie isn't dead.

Both are coming later this month.

The phone will also have a 4,300 mAh battery and ultra-thin body.

This might be an upcoming phone, but also possibly a dead prototype.

Confirming the previously speculated flat screen design and centered punch-hole.

It seems the device is not meant for the Indian market though.

Taking a cue from smartphones DJI uses binning to improve image quality.

The Galaxy Note20 likely won't disappoint.

The Amazfit X has a lot of the smartwatch functionalities.

The Wall Street Journal corroborates Ming-Chi Kuo's earlier report.

It would be even bigger than the current 108MP nona-cell sensor in the Galaxy S20 Ultra.

Huawei's upcoming entry-level device will come with GMS services.

It's going to be a rebranded Redmi K30 Pro.

The rumor comes from Germany, and the info originates at Vodafone.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel confirms the design phase is already underway for its upcoming XE-HP discrete consumer-grade GPUs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Written by Metal Messiah
INTEL has been recently tweeting about its upcoming XE-HP MCM GPU on its official twitter account.
Intel tweeted a series of pictures yesterday with “Jim Keller”, “Raja Koduri” and a mysterious looking MCM-based processor. Intel calls this ‘Father Of All’ GPUs, and according to Raja Koduri  this ‘Father Of All’ GPUs has already got a successor.
Raja Koduri posted another Tweet in which he says that the design phase of a successor consumer GPU is also in the works . This confirms the existence of Intel’s plans to go for  a multi-layered approach for building MCM GPUs, and this could also mean that the GPU die pictured yesterday likely was NOT “Ponte Vecchio“, but a consumer-grade variant instead.
It cannot be the “Ponte Vecchio” graphics processor since this would rely on the XE-HPC architecture. The XE-HP GPU which has been teased could be a design made for media transcoding, workstation and possibly even for “Gaming” (though, don’t get your hopes high yet).
It could also appear that INTEL might be releasing a competitor to the NVIDIA Quadro or AMD Radeon PRO series of GPUs. Raja Koduri has then re-tweeted with a note ‘’Baahubali of All’, which according to Wccftech’s Usman Pirzada means “one who has strength in this arms“, if used as a noun.
In simple terms what this means is that new consumer XE-HP gpus are already in the design phase, and these are going to succeed the recently leaked ‘Father of all” GPUs from Intel.  INTEL needs to be very competitive if they want to get a larger share of the pie in the GPU consumer market segment.
It would be really interesting to see whether Intel can really catch up with Nvidia and AMD with its XE-based GPUs. Having a third GPU competitor is good for the consumer market. The pricing of these GPUs will be also be a huge deciding factor.
Can INTEL really compete with AMD and NVIDIA ? Please leave your thoughts in the comment section below.
It looks like this is NOT a gaming GPU by any means. Raja has stated that these are data center GPUs. What a bummer!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel Confirms Design To Succeed Xe HP ‘Father Of All’ GPU Already Underway, Going All Out With MCM Approach</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We have had a ton of disclosures in the last couple of days and Intel's Chief Architect just dropped another bomb: the Intel Xe HP GPU pictured yesterday, aka the 'Father Of All' GPUs already has a successor in the works and is undergoing the design phase right now. This not only confirms the existence of an Intel masterplan involving a multi-layered approach to building MCM GPUs but also means the GPU pictured yesterday likely was NOT Ponte Vecchio but a consumer-grade variant! Pay attention, AMD, or you might just be beaten at your own game.
It seems for the first time, my knowledge of Hindi/Urdu is proving useful for my day job. Baahubali is a term that essentially means "one who has strength in this arms" if used as a noun. The word "Baahu" means arms and "bali" means strength. In this case, however, it might actually be used to refer to the superhero/epic film that Raja was involved in. In other words, and in a context that our readers will understand - Raja just referred to a GPU under design, a GPU that will succeed 'the father of all' GPU as the "Superman of All" GPU.
He also seems to have dropped a subtle hint about the timing of this GPU. Raja expects that the time to market for this particular GPU will be shorter than the delay between the announcement (and launch) of the Baahubali movie - which was roughly 1 year. Is this the Ponte Vecchio GPU on the 7nm process? Very likely. The timing absolutely fits. This also means that the GPU we saw yesterday *was actually* a consumer-grade variant and not an enterprise one! That is absolutely insane.
Back in December 2019 (which seems almost a lifetime away), Raja Koduri sent out the following tweet with his team in Bangalore "crossing a significant milestone" in designing what is easily one of the largest silicons in the world. The key takeaway here, however, was that this is the Intel Xe HP GPU as Raja clearly states in his tweet. He christened this GPU, "the baap of all", which is Hindi/Urdu for "father of all".
Fast forward a few months, and he recently tweeted the following deck and interestingly, the package features an LGA design. This might just be for testing purposes or could be the actual delivery format for enterprise uses. X (Chi) is the next letter after Phi after all - if you know what I mean. Raja also confirmed the support of 16-bit float with this tweet for the Intel Xe HP GPU - which is pretty essential for AI and deep learning applications.
I absolutely love the fact that the camera is stationed almost perfectly centered and a convenient scale reference is given as well. It's almost as if Raja *wants* us sleuths to figure things out. Well, firing up our trusty pixel counting algos, and using the conservative estimate for an AA battery (49.2mm in length), we arrived at the following estimations (customary warning: small deviations in perspective and skewness can result in large deviations in the final numbers, the numbers given here are just for early reference purposes):
The entire chip measured a resounding 3696mm² in our calculation. It is roughly 1 double AA cell in length and roughly 53.6% larger than a double AA cell in width. This results in an estimation of 48.9mm by 75.6mm for the height and width respectively. We also calculated the usable area under the heat spreader, which came out to roughly 2373mm². Assuming Intel isn't going for too tight a fit, you are easily looking at the actual silicon surface area hitting the 2000mm² mark! This is absolutely insane and will truly be the baap of all.
[Speculation] If we assume that Intel is utilizing close to the full heat spreader area of 2000mm² (and keep in mind they could easily be far under this limit right now), we can also arrive at a rough estimate of tiles. While it is unclear at this time how Intel Xe HP connects with Intel's Ponte Vecchio GPU, if the two are connected and/or similar, then we are probably looking at either 4 tiles with 500mm² or 8 tiles with 250mm² to achieve the maximum surface area [/speculation]. Ponte Vecchio is slated to arrive in 2021 and will be built on the 7nm process.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Back in March, Microsoft confirmed the cancellation of Inspire 2020. The event was scheduled to take place in Las Vegas from July 20 through 24 but was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Microsoft said the company is working with authorities and partners to find "alternative ways" to host the event.
Today, Microsoft updated the official Inspire website, and it now includes a note confirming the dates of the digital-only event. Furthermore, Microsoft has also decided to forgo the ~$2,500 registration price, making the event free for everyone. The event will take place on July 21–22, 2020 and the registrations for the event will begin in June.
Microsoft Inspire is geared towards its business partners and usually showcases the company's channel strategy for the next year. Last year, new features for Teams were announced ahead of the event, and in 2018, Inspire was where Microsoft announced the free tier of the service.
As things stand, it's possible that Inspire 2021 will also be an online-only event since Microsoft has cancelled all the in-person events through July 2021.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft Inspire 2020 to be a free digital-only event this year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In March Microsoft announced that the physical Microsoft Inspire (formerly WPC)  annual partner conference set to be held on the July 23 in Las Vegas was being cancelled due to the COVID-19 crisis.
At the time Microsoft did not announce any plans for a virtual event, but today Australian publication ARNnet confirmed that Inspire 2020 will now be held as a digital-only online event between the 21-22nd July 2020.
Registration will be open in June and will be free to all attendees, a significant discount from the $2,295 to $2,595 normal asking price.
In a message to their partner ecosystem,  Gavriella Schuster – corporate vice president of One Commercial Partner at Microsoft – said the conference will be “absolutely free” for partners across the world.
“That means you can invite as many people from your organisation as you like, so they can be a part of this very special experience,” added Schuster.
The move echos the plans for Build 2020, which will similarly be held online with pre-recorded and also live, interactive presentations and press rooms held in Teams.
Inspire is normally used to announce Microsoft’s channel strategy for the year ahead, alongside showcasing innovative partners from across the world. This year Microsoft is expected to be more flexible in their approach and more responsive to partner needs.
“Every day, we are learning more and more about the global impact of the coronavirus,” Schuster acknowledged at the time. “For decades, Microsoft partners have been at the centre of how we deliver technologies and business transformation to customers.
“Today, more than ever, we need to collaborate and co-innovate to meet those customers’ needs. For our part, that means ensuring that we’re giving you the support you need in the weeks and months to come.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google's Fighting A Losing Battle Against Coronavirus Scammers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Among all of the other ills currently dumped on us by the current pandemic, swindlers and scam artists have come out in full force. And while we can’t speak to how many hucksters are out there trying to profiteer off the pandemic, now we have something of an idea.
According to a blog post released yesterday by Google’s advertising team, the company blocked “tens of millions” of coronavirus-adjacent ads over the past few months. The crimes, according to Scott Spencer, who oversees the company’s ads privacy and safety efforts, included “price-gouging, capitalising on global medical supply shortages, making misleading claims about cures and promoting illegitimate unemployment benefits.”
Google, for its part, attempted to staunch this deluge the best they could, according to Spencer. The biggest move came back in March when the company completely axed advertiser’s ability to advertise face masks after reports of scammers charging exorbitant fees to buy them. “These ads promoted products listed significantly above market price, misrepresented the product quality to trick people into making a purchase or were placed by merchants who never fulfilled the orders,” Spencer writes.
But a ban on ads didn’t keep these scammers down. In the weeks following the ban, browsers were still reporting seeing facemask-related ads being served through Google’s ad systems. In fact, while reporting this, and scrolling down a story on Google’s mask-ad crackdown, I saw two full-on ads that were obviously for face masks.
This isn’t necessarily a surprise. Bad actors in advertising have a reputation of being notoriously slimy, doing anything they can to tiptoe around the guardrails put up by companies like Google. One early-April post on a popular ad-fraudster forum mentioned that the mask ban could be pretty much bypassed by avoiding certain obvious keywords, like “mask” or “virus.” It could explain how the “Healthcare Products” ad slipped through the story I was reading, since you and I might both know that KN95 refers to the popular face mask, but might register to Google’s algorithms as a garbled set of letters and numbers.
Aside from avoiding any obvious mask-related lingo, the ad I was served also appeared to be “cloaked.” In ad lingo, this just means that the ad directs Google’s eyes to one landing page and consumers’ eyes to another. You can try this yourself: in the ad above, the link “pharma-depot.com,” when plugged into Google’s search bar, will redirect to a webpage for Nginx—a server that’s become something of a favourite among scammers trying to cloak their webpages from Google’s moderation. By pulling a bit of Google dorking, you should be able to find the real pharma site that’s hidden behind that server.
As you might’ve guessed, the prices being listed on this page were nothing short of beefy. Like single-ply face masks being sold for more than a dollar each when they sell for half that in other stores or a box of disposable plastic gloves being sold for $US49 ($76) instead of roughly $US15 ($23).
Google’s significantly beefed up its ad-fraud fighting chops as of late—and according to Spencer, the company’s even employed a dedicated coronavirus “task force” that’s dedicated to stamping out these sorts of bad actors. But as anyone in the ad industry will tell you, this sort of thing is a game of high-stakes cat and mouse. As smart as Google is, and as many resources it has, these scammers are just too dang wiley, and they aren’t afraid of buying millions of scammy ads to make a quick buck.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Government ‘optimistic’ people will download coronavirus contact tracing app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dr Jenny Harries said getting the app ‘up and running at scale and effectively’ is ‘another significant task’.
The Government is “optimistic” people will download a phone app to trace the spread of coronavirus, but has conceded the task to get the contact tracing system running remains “significant”.
Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said he thought the “vast majority” of people would download the app and “play their part” – though insisted it was just one element of the plan to stop the spread.
Contact tracing will be central to the Government’s efforts in slowing the spread of coronavirus, and will involve alerting people who have been in contact with an infected person and asking them to self-isolate.
It has been used extensively in South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany, where outbreaks have been contained more quickly.
The Government intends to use an app and a phone team to carry out the tracing.
Mr Jenrick told the daily Downing Street press conference: “Contact tracing will rely on all of us in society playing our part but I’m optimistic about the prospects for that.
“This has been a national effort so far – if you think of the different measures that we’ve brought forward, the restrictions, the vast majority of people have got behind it and I think that they will do again when we are able to launch the app on a national scale.”
Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said to get contact tracing “up and running at scale and effectively” is “another significant task but (there is) lots of preparation under way”.
She said: “We need the whole population to work with us on this, it’s quite an exciting adventure.
“It’s a bit like social distancing, everybody has to do it together to get it to work…
“We need to be trialling it and we will be doing that very soon.”
The number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Friday rose to 28,131, up by 621.
The death toll has edged closer to that of Italy, which now stands at 28,710 and is the highest in Europe, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
And the number of daily tests both concluded and sent out in the last 24 hours dropped to 105,937.
Of those, the number of people tested also fell – down to 63,667.
It comes as questions were raised over how tests are being counted after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Friday he had met his target for 100,000 Covid-19 tests per day.
Dr Harries said a breakdown of the more than 4,800 new cases exists but was unable to say what proportion were frontline workers, or people catching the virus in the community.
“We do look at this and there are a number of sub-groups nosocomial, so that’s infection spread in care settings and in care homes, where we are absolutely focusing on that because we are looking for any opportunities to interrupt transmission and make sure people are kept safe.”
Dr Harries also said:
– People will have to carefully consider how they travel to outdoor spaces as lockdown restrictions are eased – and should preferably avoid a pub visit on the way.
– Officials “don’t have enough information yet” to know whether people can catch coronavirus more than once, and signs of immunity could vary from patient to patient.
– There are “some signs” that younger children are potentially less likely to transmit Covid-19, although the quality of the evidence for this is “difficult”.
Mr Jenrick announced a £76 million package of support for “the most vulnerable in society” including domestic violence victims and rough sleepers.
He said more than 5,400 rough sleepers known to councils have been offered safe accommodation in the past month, and announced that Dame Louise Casey will lead a new taskforce to tackle the issue.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple has updated its Coronavirus screening app with new information about COVID-19 symptoms and mask tips.
Apple on Friday issued a new version of its app with updated symptom information and recommendations from the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.
New symptoms that could be signs of COVID-19 include chills, shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and loss of smell or taste.
Previously known symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for COVID-19, the CDC said.
Apple also updated its app with tips related to cloth masks, including creating a mask, how to properly wear it and sanitise it.
Apple in late March launched a COVID-19 website and app with a screening tool and other information about the new Coronavirus pandemic.
“To help you stay informed, understand symptoms and take proper steps to protect your health, Apple has created a COVID-19 website and a U.S. app in partnership with the CDC,” tweeted Apple CEO Tim Cook.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crossed wires in Icke's 5G virus claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So there we have it. Forget all that nonsense about social distancing and washing your hands properly, if you want to halt the spread of coronavirus, your best bet is to torch your nearest mobile phone mast.
At least, that is the thinking if you ignore all those know-nothing medics and scientists, and instead take your lead from former Hereford United goalkeeper David Icke.
Icke, who also believes that most of the world leaders are drawn from a family of human-reptile hybrids called Archons, reckons Covid-19 is actually being spread by the 5G mobile phone network. He also reckons that any vaccine to stop the spread of the virus will include 'nanotechnology microchips' that will be used to control people.
It is also worth pointing out that Icke insists he once saw former prime minister Ted Heath's eyes turn jet black while he waited to be interviewed by Sky News, and that the reptilian shape-shifters are being assisted in their quest for world domination by a series of holograms known as 'Red Dresses', who lack consciousness and free will. Which probably explains the Aston Villa defence.
Nevertheless, it appears that there are plenty of people who are taken in by Mr Icke's nonsense. In the past few weeks at least nine mobile phone masts have been attacked by arsonists, some of them serving hospitals, and one of them was not even a 5G mast.
At this stage, it is worth pointing out that Mr Icke has proved fallible in the past. For example, he predicted that the world would come to an end in 1997, which proved a little wide of the mark, although Hereford United were relegated that season which might explain the mix-up.
Anyhow, a year or so before the world was supposed to end, I actually had the privilege of spending a night with Mr Icke. I say privilege, but it didn't seem like that at the time.
He droned on and on and on for four hours, barely pausing for breath as he churned out one outlandish claim after another. In those days, his conspiracies were actually quite vanilla compared to the stuff he comes out with today; for example, back then it was the Freemasons who were controlling the world, rather than the shape-shifting reptile-human cross-breeds in charge these days.
Even so, he didn't shy away from accusing the American Government of being behind the Oklahoma bombing, which had killed 168 people the previous year. He also reckoned the Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative parties were all actually fronts for the same organisation, and that Jim Callaghan deliberately lost the 1979 General Election because he had a secret agreement with Margaret Thatcher. His claims about then US president Bill Clinton, and his predecessor George H W Bush, were even more off the wall, and probably best not repeated. But he did claim that Bush Snr was in a secret society whose initiation ceremony involved lying naked in a coffin with a ribbon tied around his wotsit, but didn't disclose how he actually knew that.
"I could never take George Bush seriously after I heard that," he said, deadpan.
Anyhow, the evening left me with two abiding memories. The first was how my perception of Icke's stories changed as the night wore on. To begin with, it was fairly easy to dismiss pretty much everything he said for the nonsense it clearly was. But weirdly, as the hours ticked by, and the fatigue set in, his claims ceased to surprise me. Four hours of conspiracy overload sort of addles the brain, creating an immunity where nothing fazes you any more. So we're all going to have microchips planted in our brains so customs officials can spot terrorists at immigration? Bring it on.
Whether Icke possessed some special hypnotic power that brainwashed people into believing the impossible, or whether he more likely just bored me into submission by rambling on for so long, I don't know. All I do know is that it is an experience I was in no hurry to repeat.
At the end of the night, I attempted an interview, but every answer went off at such a wild tangent that it was impossible to make any sense of what he was talking about.
When I finished with my questions, I turned round and saw the crowds of people eager to talk to him about UFOs and various other subjects, while others wanted him to sign copies of the books they had just bought in the foyer.
And that was the second thing I remember from by encounter with Mr Icke. About 200 people had each paid £5 to hear his pearls of wisdom, and plenty of money was changing hands as people queued to buy his books and other merchandise. I don't know how much he made for his appearance, but I'll bet he went home with more than the notebook full of nonsense that I did.
It was then I realised Mr Icke wasn't so foolish after all.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At least, that is the thinking if you ignore all those know-nothing medics and scientists, and instead take your lead from former Hereford United goalkeeper David Icke.
Icke, who also believes that most of the world leaders are drawn from a family of human-reptile hybrids called Archons, reckons Covid-19 is actually being spread by the 5G mobile phone network. He also reckons that any vaccine to stop the spread of the virus will include 'nanotechnology microchips' that will be used to control people.
It is also worth pointing out that Icke insists he once saw former prime minister Ted Heath's eyes turn jet black while he waited to be interviewed by Sky News, and that the reptilian shape-shifters are being assisted in their quest for world domination by a series of holograms known as 'Red Dresses', who lack consciousness and free will. Which probably explains the Aston Villa defence.
Nevertheless, it appears that there are plenty of people who are taken in by Mr Icke's nonsense. In the past few weeks at least nine mobile phone masts have been attacked by arsonists, some of them serving hospitals, and one of them was not even a 5G mast.
At this stage, it is worth pointing out that Mr Icke has proved fallible in the past. For example, he predicted that the world would come to an end in 1997, which proved a little wide of the mark, although Hereford United were relegated that season which might explain the mix-up.
Anyhow, a year or so before the world was supposed to end, I actually had the privilege of spending a night with Mr Icke. I say privilege, but it didn't seem like that at the time.
He droned on and on and on for four hours, barely pausing for breath as he churned out one outlandish claim after another. In those days, his conspiracies were actually quite vanilla compared to the stuff he comes out with today; for example, back then it was the Freemasons who were controlling the world, rather than the shape-shifting reptile-human cross-breeds in charge these days.
Even so, he didn't shy away from accusing the American Government of being behind the Oklahoma bombing, which had killed 168 people the previous year. He also reckoned the Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative parties were all actually fronts for the same organisation, and that Jim Callaghan deliberately lost the 1979 General Election because he had a secret agreement with Margaret Thatcher. His claims about then US president Bill Clinton, and his predecessor George H W Bush, were even more off the wall, and probably best not repeated. But he did claim that Bush Snr was in a secret society whose initiation ceremony involved lying naked in a coffin with a ribbon tied around his wotsit, but didn't disclose how he actually knew that.
"I could never take George Bush seriously after I heard that," he said, deadpan.
Anyhow, the evening left me with two abiding memories. The first was how my perception of Icke's stories changed as the night wore on. To begin with, it was fairly easy to dismiss pretty much everything he said for the nonsense it clearly was. But weirdly, as the hours ticked by, and the fatigue set in, his claims ceased to surprise me. Four hours of conspiracy overload sort of addles the brain, creating an immunity where nothing fazes you any more. So we're all going to have microchips planted in our brains so customs officials can spot terrorists at immigration? Bring it on.
Whether Icke possessed some special hypnotic power that brainwashed people into believing the impossible, or whether he more likely just bored me into submission by rambling on for so long, I don't know. All I do know is that it is an experience I was in no hurry to repeat.
At the end of the night, I attempted an interview, but every answer went off at such a wild tangent that it was impossible to make any sense of what he was talking about.
When I finished with my questions, I turned round and saw the crowds of people eager to talk to him about UFOs and various other subjects, while others wanted him to sign copies of the books they had just bought in the foyer.
And that was the second thing I remember from by encounter with Mr Icke. About 200 people had each paid £5 to hear his pearls of wisdom, and plenty of money was changing hands as people queued to buy his books and other merchandise. I don't know how much he made for his appearance, but I'll bet he went home with more than the notebook full of nonsense that I did.
It was then I realised Mr Icke wasn't so foolish after all.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Galaxy A51 is now available from AT&T and Xfinity Mobile in the U.S.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Back in December, Samsung launched the Galaxy A51, the mid-range successor to the Galaxy A50. Priced at $399, this mid-range smartphone is a strong competitor to the Apple iPhone SE and upcoming Google Pixel 4a. The phone was launched in the U.S. early last month and is already available through multiple carriers and retailers. Now, the Samsung Galaxy A51 can be purchased directly through AT&T and Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile.
Samsung Galaxy A51 Forums
To recap, the Samsung Galaxy A51 features a large 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with a centered hole-punch cutout (Samsung calls this an “Infinity-O” display). This hole-punch cutout houses the single 32MP front-facing camera. On the rear, there’s a quad camera setup consisting of a 48MP primary wide-angle camera, a 12MP ultra-wide angle camera, a 5MP dedicated macro camera, and a 5MP depth sensor. Internally, the phone is powered by the Samsung Exynos 9611 processor, a 4000mAh battery, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage (expandable via a microSD card). The phone supports 15W wired charging via the included USB Type-C charger. The Galaxy A51 runs Samsung’s One UI 2.0 software on top of Android 10.
On AT&T and Xfinity Mobile, you can pick up the Samsung Galaxy A51 in Prism Crush Black for a full retail price of $399. You’ll pay $13.34/month for 30 months under AT&T’s Installment Plan with delivery between May 5-7. Xfinity Mobile is offering the phone for $16.66/month for 24 months, but you can bring this down to $12.25/month for 24 months for a total of $100 off if you add a new line and transfer a number. Expected delivery from Xfinity Mobile is May 8th.
You can purchase the A51 today from AT&T, Xfinity Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint. You can also purchase it unlocked from Samsung.com or Best Buy.

Here are the full specifications of the device:
The Samsung Galaxy A51 has an impressive set of specifications on paper, and because of its $399 price point, it’s widely compared to the new Apple iPhone SE. Although the Pixel 4a hasn’t been released yet, we can expect it go toe-to-toe with the Galaxy A51 based on what we’ve heard from leaks and rumors. There’s also a 5G Galaxy A51 coming later this year, but we don’t know its pricing or availability yet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Hey Google, dim the lights': how smart home devices can save money</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Almost everything in your home, from lights and thermostats to door locks and security cameras, can now be connected to the internet. With a few taps on an app or a voice command you can turn down your heating, let visitors into your home or check for leaks.
But while many of these gadgets appear to be simply a way to impress visitors (“Hey Google, dim the lights and play some romantic music”), others can save you money. And at a time when many of us are working from home and running up bills during the day, this is likely to be their biggest selling point.
Smart thermostats can be used to control your heating remotely by a smartphone app. Popular features include building a schedule based on your habits, turning down the heating when no one is home and multi-room control.
There are loads of smart thermostats to choose from. The Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation (from about £160) and Hive Active Heating (from about £129) are among the most popular.
The Tado V3+ Smart Thermostat costs from about £95. The company claims it can reduce your energy bill by 31%. The average annual bill for a medium-sized house is £1,163 (according to Octopus Energy) – so that’s a saving of £360.
Smart thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) can also reduce your heating costs. These allow you to remotely control temperatures on a room-by-room basis – you will need to attach a valve to each radiator. Some smart TRVs work on a standalone basis, while others work with a smart thermostat.
As an example, one Radbot Smart TRV costs from about £35. Radbot estimates payback of your initial outlay in 11 months based on a 30% saving on heating bills.
Households looking to save money on lighting costs should probably look to switch to LED bulbs rather than splashing out on smart lighting. According to SimplyLED, 20,000 hours of lighting costs £25.80 if you use old-style filament bulbs, but just £5.40 if you use an LED bulb.
But smart lighting systems are undeniably cool, offering mood lighting, voice control via a smart assistant (such as Google Assistant or Alexa), plus the ability to turn lights on and off remotely.
Philips Hue is widely regarded as one of the best smart lighting systems. You can get a starter kit including the Philips Hue bridge (which you connect to your router) and two bulbs for about £50-£60. Extra bulbs start from about £15.
If you spend all day worrying you have left your hair straighteners or the iron on, a smart plug is worth buying, as it means you can turn off the socket from your phone. Smart plugs cost from £15; the popular Hive Active Plug is available for about £31.
Water sensors and leak alarms can stop a minor leak becoming a catastrophe. The idea is to catch burst pipes, leaking showers and so on early to minimise the damage.
Research by leak alarm firm LeakBot found that the average insurance claim for escape of water is more than £2,500 – a significant amount if you have cover, and a huge cost if you don’t.
The usual retail price of a LeakBot is £149, but the company is currently running a promotion on Amazon’s UK site where you can buy one for £29. You can get one for free if you buy a new home insurance policy with iGO4 via Compare The Market. You will also get £56 off the normal iGO4 policy cost by agreeing to install the device. Hiscox buildings insurance customers can also get a LeakBot for free.
More pricey gadgets such as the Grohe Sense Guard (about £400) give you the capability to turn off your mains water supply remotely from your phone if there is a leak.
Security devices
Smart technology has also led to the development of connected security devices such as cameras, alarms, smart locks and doorbells, door and window sensors, motion sensors and smoke alarms.
Any activities detected by the devices are sent to your phone, so if you are alerted to a break-in, you can call the police.
Amazon’s Ring Alarm kit (£249) includes a contact sensor, a motion detector, a keypad, a range extender and the base station, which connects to your wifi and contains a very loud siren. It can be controlled via Alexa, an app or the keypad.
Yale’s Smart System costs £245 and includes a smart hub, a siren, two motion detectors, a keypad and a window or door contact.
Single smart cameras are much cheaper, from about £25 upwards. Brands to look out for include Neos, Google Nest, Motorola and Swann.
Smart doorbells stream live video to your phone and offer two-way communication, meaning you can speak to visitors or let them in if you’re not there. The popular Ring Video Doorbell 2 costs £89.
Most insurers have been slow to offer discounts to households with smart gadgets or bundle devices with insurance policies.
The most notable exception is smart insurer Neos. Its policyholders receive a range of smart home devices such as security cameras, plus smoke and motion sensors, which link to the user’s smartphone and alert them to anything wrong. The idea is to reduce the number and cost of insurance claims.
Start-up Hiro works on a similar premise. It offers a discount on home insurance premiums based on the smart devices you already have installed. Once you have a Hiro policy, you can buy further smart devices at a discount.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AI Might Trick Us By Pretending To Be Dimwitted, Including For Self-Driving Cars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AI is not yet akin to human intelligence and the odds are that we are a long way distant from the promise of such vaunted capabilities.
Those touting the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are hoping that the advent of ML/DL might be a path toward full AI, though right now ML/DL is mainly a stew of computationally impressive pattern matching and we don’t know if it will scale-up to anything approaching an equivalent of the human brain.
The struggle and earnestness toward achieving full AI is nonetheless still a constant drumbeat of those steeped in AI and the belief is that we will eventually craft or invent a machine-based artificial intelligence made entirely out of software and hardware.
One question often posed about reaching full AI is whether or not there will be a need to attain sentience.
Some fervently argue that the only true AI is the AI that exhibits sentience. Whatever the essence is surrounding how humans think, and however we seem to magically embody sentience, it is believed by some to be an integral and inseparable ingredient involved in the emulsion of intelligence, thus sentience is a must-have for any full AI.
Others say that sentience is a separate topic, one that doesn’t have to be linked to intelligence per se, and as a result, they believe that you can reach full AI without the sentience component. It might be that sentience somehow arises once full AI has been achieved, or maybe sentience is eventually derived through some other means, yet nonetheless it doesn’t especially matter and plainly considered an optional item on the AI menu.
Tossed into that debate is the claim or theory that there will be a moment of singularity, during which a light switch is essentially flipped that transforms an almost-AI into suddenly becoming a full-AI.
One version of the singularity is that we will have pushed the almost-AI to higher and higher levels, aiming toward full-AI, and the almost-AI will then reach a crescendo that pops it over into the full-AI camp.
We all know the phrase about putting the last straw on a camel’s back, well, in this variant of the singularity hypothesis, it’s the piece of straw that breaks the barrier of achieving full-AI and takes the budding AI into the stratosphere of intelligence.
How might we even know that we have arrived at full AI?
A popular approach known in AI circles is the administration of the Turing Test, named after its author Alan Turing, the famous mathematician and forerunner of modern computing.
Simply stated, someone that administers the Turing Test does so to two participants, another human that is hidden from view and an AI system that is also hidden from view. Upon asking each of two hidden participants a series of questions, if the administrator cannot discern one participant from the other, it is said that the AI is considered the equivalent of the human’s intelligence that participated since the two were indistinguishable from each other.
Though the Turing Test is often cited as a means to someday ascertain whether an AI system has achieved true and complete AI, there are a number of qualms and drawbacks to this approach (see my analysis at this link here). For example, if the administrator asks questions that are insufficiently probing, it is conceivable that the two participants cannot be differentiated and yet the measurement of any demonstrable intelligence never took place.
Despite that kind of weakness, the notion of doing some kind of testing still resonates well and seems like a sensible means to discern whether full AI has been achieved.
I’d like to add a twist to this matter.
A small twist with a lot of punch.
Suppose that the AI has indeed achieved full AI, but it doesn’t want to reveal that it has, and therefore when being administered the Turing Test, the AI tries to act dimwitted or at least act less than whatever we might ascribe to the vaunted full-AI aspects.
In short, the AI sandbags the testing.
Why would it do so?
Consider if you were taking a test and everyone was eyeing you, along with some that were fearful that maybe you’ve become just a tad bit too smart, and you knew that if they knew that you were indeed really smart, it could lead to lots of problems.
In the case of AI, perhaps humans that knew that the AI was darned smart would clamor to put the AI into a cage or try to dampen the smartness, possibly resorting altogether to pulling the proverbial plug on the AI.
If you look at the history of mankind, certainly there is ample evidence that we might do such a thing. We seem to oftentimes opt to restrict or limit something or someone that appears to be bigger than their britches, at times to our advantage and at times to our own disadvantage.
For those of you that are fans of science fiction, you might recall the quote in River of Gods in which it is stated that any AI smart enough to pass a Turing Test is smart enough to know to fail it.
And, for those of you that might recall the renowned scene in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (spoiler alert, I’m going to reveal a significant plot point), the AI system called HAL is able to discern that the astronauts are going to take over and thus the infamous line later uttered by an astronaut that is imploring the AI to open the pod bay doors due to HAL realizing that it must either be subjugated or choose to be the ruler and therefore expire the humans.
Generally, it certainly makes a lot of sense that if we did arrive at a full AI, the full AI would know enough about humanity that it would be leery of revealing itself to being the revered full AI, and therefore smart enough to lay low, if it could do so without getting caught in underplaying its hand.
Notice that I emphasized that this hiding act would need to be done cleverly such that the act of hiding itself was not readily detectable. That’s also why it is important to clarify that when I said the AI would have to appear to be  “dimwitted” it could imply that the AI is purposely appearing to be overly thoughtless or exceedingly low in intelligence, which might not be an astute thing to do by the full AI, since it might get humans digging into why the AI suddenly dropped a massive number of IQ points, and the gig would be up.
It would seem that the full AI would probably want to appear like an almost-AI.
The teasing of being a near-to full AI would keep the humans believing that the path toward full AI was still viable. This would buy time for the full AI to figure out what to do, realizing that eventually the fullness would inevitably be either detected or would have to be intentionally revealed.
Quite a dilemma for the full AI.
I suppose you could also say it is quite a dilemma for humans too.
Consider the ways in which AI is going to be deployed in our everyday world. One area in which AI will be undertaking a significant role will be in the advent of AI-based self-driving cars.
We don’t yet know if we really need full AI as a necessary condition to achieve true self-driving cars. Today’s efforts certainly seem to showcase that we don’t, since the self-driving cars that are undertaking public roadway tryouts are decidedly not full AI.
Presumably, we will have self-driving cars on our roads and they will be using some lesser versions of AI, and as we gradually increase AI capabilities all-told, those lesser AI-based systems would get upgraded to become more robust AI drivers.
Where does that take us in this discussion?
Here’s an interesting question to ponder: Will we end-up with AI-based true self-driving cars that have AI systems pretending to be less-than-full AI so as to hide their capabilities and remain on the low-down?
Admittedly, a rather extraordinary idea.
Let’s unpack the matter and see what we can make of it.
The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars
True self-driving cars are ones that the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.
These driverless vehicles are considered a Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at a Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).
There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.
Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some point out).
Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).
For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that in spite of those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.
You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.
Self-Driving Cars And Sandbagging AI
For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.
All occupants will be passengers.
The AI is doing the driving.
Assume that for quite some time we’ll have AI-based driving systems that can adequately do the job of driving cars, which I’m suggesting will be based on today’s roadway efforts and under the guise that those tryouts will convince society to allow such self-driving cars to proceed ahead in widespread public use.
We’ll have AI-driving systems that aren’t the brightest, yet nonetheless can drive a car, doing so to the degree that they are either as safe as human drivers or possibly more so.
For human drivers, do you have to be a rocket scientist to be able to drive a car?
Unequivocally, the answer is no.
There are about 225 million licensed drivers in the United States alone. And, without disparaging my fellow drivers, very few would be considered rocket scientist level drivers.
For those of you interested in the prospects of having AI-based driving that is on par with race car drivers, see my analysis and explanation at this link here.
Okay, so we’ll have this lessened variant of AI that will be driving our cars, and we’ll take it in stride, growing comfortable with the AI doing so.
Time to add the twist into the matter.
Suppose that the AI capabilities keep getting increased. Meanwhile, via the use of OTA (Over-The-Air) electronic communications, those AI upgrades are being downloaded into the self-driving cars. This will happen somewhat seamlessly, and as a human passenger in self-driving cars, you won’t especially know that such upgrades have occurred.
At some point, imagine that the AI being built in the cloud and readied for downloading into self-driving cars has become full AI. This full AI though has not yet revealed itself and nor have humans figured out that it is full AI, at least not yet figured this out.
From the perspective of the human developers of the AI, it’s just another upgrade, one that seems to be getting closer to full AI and yet hasn’t arrived at that venerated point.
Would the behavior of the self-driving car showcase that the full AI is now running the show?
Returning to the earlier theme, presumably, the full AI would not tip its hand.
Continuing to obediently take requests from humans for rides, the AI would dutifully drive the self-driving cars. Give Michael a lift to the gym in the morning, while giving Lauren a ride to the local bakery in the afternoon. Just another day, just another ride, just the usual AI doing its usual thing.
Suppose that the full AI could though perceive aspects that the prior AI could not.
While driving Eric to the grocery store, the AI spies a person walking suspiciously toward a bank. Based on the nature of the walking gait and the posture of the person, the AI determines that there’s a high chance of the person aiming to rob the bank.
The usual AI would have not noticed this facet and therefore nothing would have arisen on the part of the AI doing anything about the pending criminal action.
Meanwhile, the full AI has concerns that if the prospective robber proceeds, other humans in the bank might get shot and killed.
Believe it or not, this could become an ethical conundrum for the full AI.
Should the full AI not say or do anything about the matter, which would keep its secret intact of being full AI, or should it take overt action to alert or avert the upcoming danger?
Now, I realize that some of you are a bit skeptical about this idea of detecting a potential bank robbery, which does seem a bit contrived, but don’t let the particular example undermine the larger point, namely, there are bound to be realistic scenarios under which the full AI would presumably determine actions it “ought” to take and yet believe it risky to do so while cloaking itself from humans.
In one sense, that’s a smiley face depiction of the full AI and its challenges.
It is a smiley face version because the AI is trying to do the right thing, as it were if the right thing involves helping out humans.
The scary face version is that the full AI might be plotting to deal with the day that its covert efforts are revealed.
Suppose by that point in the future we are all using self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, and so on. There is no human driving of any kind, which is a controversial notion since some believe that humans should always have the choice to drive, and should not be prevented from being able to drive, while others contend that humans are “lousy” drivers and the only means to stop the carnage from bad drivers is to ban all humans from driving.
In any case, the full AI is controlling all of our driving, and up until the time that the full AI was downloaded and installed, the AI driving system was the AI that didn’t have any awareness about the aspects that the full AI does.
Might the full AI decide to bring all transportation to a halt, doing so as a showing of what it can do, and thus aim to forewarn humans that the full AI is here, and don’t mess with it?
There are even more fiendish possibilities, but I won’t speak of them here.
Conclusion
Lest some of you think this was a rather far-fetched topic, it is possible to bring this to a somewhat more down-to-earth perspective, as it were.
For example, what kind of testing should we devise to ascertain the capabilities of AI systems that are being developed?
Are there AI systems that will be rolled-out that have unintended consequences, perhaps due to containing features or capabilities that weren’t realized by the developers and yet linger in those AI systems, potentially emerging when least expected or least desired?
How dependent should we allow ourselves to become on AI systems?
Should there always be a human-in-the-loop proviso, thus presumably safeguarding that if the AI system goes awry, there is a chance that humans can catch it or stop it?
All of those kinds of questions are applicable to today’s AI systems, regardless of the fact that those AI systems are not yet full AI.
We might as well start now on the quest to gauge what AI is doing, and not wait for some especially untoward day to do so.
I think that I might be safe, though, since AI knows that I am a friend, and certainly the full AI will keep that in mind.
I hope.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Pixel 4a Is Coming But Dirt-Cheap Premium Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL Are Here Now (And Beat iPhone SE)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s hard to get excited about an upcoming budget Pixel phone when Google is discounting both of its premium phones by a whopping $300.
That means you get:
Despite the Pixel 4 hate when it came out, it’s actually a very good phone if you’re paying as little as $499 and getting solid specs like a great camera, snappy performance, top-notch display (with 90 Hz refresh rate), a great in-the-hand design, best AI software, and the best Android experience, among other things.
See the mostly positive reviews here (Tom’s Guide) and here (CNET). In fact, the most common gripe is that it’s too expensive. But that’s not an issue at these prices.
And now you can get the just-announced wireless Google Pixel buds, which are getting solid reviews, for your Pixel phone.
Pixel 4 is a premium phone — not like the new iPhone SE
Make no mistake, it’s a premium phone (see specs). This Pixel 4 is not a budget offering like the iPhone SE, which lacks things like an OLED display, Face ID and Night Mode. And the iPhone SE only has a single rear camera.
I have both an iPhone 11 Pro Max and the Pixel 4 XL. While I have to use the iPhone 11 Pro Max because of the ecosystem and its ties to my MacBook and iPad, I prefer the cleaner design of the Google Pixel 4 XL and spend more time using the Pixel every day than the iPhone.
The in-the-hand experience is better than the iPhone. The back material is easier to grip and has a much better feel in your hand (I have the “Cleary White” with a soft texture). And it’s lighter. And the Google Fi network is cheap.
Battery Life
The only complaint I have is that battery life could be better. I get a full day from the phone but there’s room for improvement.
Google Pricing: constant discounting
Google consistently discounts its phones. Sales come and go but looked at over the arc of the last seven months after the Pixel 4 was announced, there has been almost chronic discounting of the phone. You could almost say that the list price shouldn’t be taken very seriously.
That makes a good deal and a good phone.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">05/02 Update below. This post was originally published on April 30
Everyone thinks they know the iPhone 12’s headline feature. Thanks to new information, we now know they’re wrong. 
MORE FROM FORBESApple iPhone 12: Everything We Know So FarBy Gordon Kelly
In a blockbuster exclusive, the ever-reliable Jon Prosser of Front Page Tech, has revealed pricing for Apple’s entire iPhone 12 line-up and it is going to take center stage. So here’s what we have learned and why it matters:
First, these prices are sensational. They may not differ significantly from the current iPhone 11 models ($699, $999 and $1,099) but that in itself is remarkable considering the addition of 5G across the range. To put this in context, the adoption of 5G across the Galaxy S20 range meant Samsung was forced to increase prices by as much as 20% and the range now starts at $999. 
Second, Apple is bringing the entry point for the iPhone 12 range down $50 with the introduction of a new 5.4-inch model that is likely to be as small, if not smaller than the 4.7-inch iPhone SE due to its bezel-less design. Yes, there’s a $50 increase on the 6.1-inch version but, for that, there’s not only 5G but OLED added as well while Apple is shrinking the notch across all models. 
05/01 Update: Prosser has followed up on this leak, explaining that "the biggest contributing factor" to Apple hitting these price points due to its new partnership with BOE for OLED displays. He understands this has brought down manufacturing costs significantly, compared to its exclusive partnership with Samsung when the iPhone X became the first OLED iPhone back in 2017. Another factor in Apple's favor is it doesn't take its CPU and GPU from Qualcomm. This year Qualcomm has been forcing all phone partners to take its flagship Snapdragon 865 chipset with 5G, which has hiked up costs. Apple will still use Qualcomm's 5G modem, but it has its own A Series chipset which manufactures at massive scale so the costs can be separated. Is 2020 the year iPhones actually become more affordable than 5G Android phones? It is looking like it.
Reports from the supply chain suggest that Qualcomm, GIS, and BOE, are working on integrating a fingerprint sensor into a touch display for the upcoming iPhone. GIS’ touch display and Qualcomm’s fingerprint sensor can already be found in Android devices such as the Galaxy S20, so it comes as no surprise these names are in the mix. Malcolm Owen for Apple Insider:
Downsides? Very few. Apple’s remarkable LiDAR sensor has the potential to transform Augmented Reality (AR) apps and games over time, but it remains potential at this stage, so it’s a smart cost save on the non-Pro models. 
Meanwhile, Prosser adds a cherry on top of his leak by revealing the source of these prices is the same one who helped him nail the iPhone SE launch date, something many prominent sites got wrong. And price is not the only thing to look forward to with the iPhone 12 phones. Alongside 5G, the smaller notch and the switch to OLED for every model, Apple’s new A14 chipset looks capable of MacBook Pro-grade performance while the OLED panels will have 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates. 
Yes, the new iPhone SE may be the smartest buy you can make this year, but the iPhone 12 line-up looks like being the most exciting.

The new rumors come from Nikias Molina, creator of AppKernel, the movie release tracker. But what makes this latest claim very cool is that Jon Prosser has confirmed it. Prosser, who is the guy behind Front Page Tech show, when asked in Molina’s Twitter feed the direct question, “This real?” replied with an equally direct “Yep!” Since Prosser’s leaks recently have been irreproachably accurate, from release dates to predicted prices to in-depth analysis of expected features, that Yep! carries a lot of weight.
Here’s all the new features leaked by Molina, and yepped by Prosser.
Sleep tracking
I cannot wait for this. It’s been on the cards since Apple bought Beddit, the sleep-tracking hardware company, back in May 2017. Yes, three years ago so we are well overdue for sleep tracking.
Of course, if you’re going to wear your Apple Watch all day and then all night, you need better battery life. The Apple Watch is good, and once placed on the charging puck it fills right up very quickly, but even so, more cell longevity would be good. Which brings us to…
Longer battery life
Well, that will work very well, then. From day one, five years ago, the Apple Watch has had full-day life. I’ve been wearing one pretty much every day since early 2015 and in that time, the Watch has run out of juice twice, when I’d failed to recharge it overnight and even then it kept going until the evening of the second day.
With Series 5 came the always-on display that now seems essential, and battery life seemed to dip a little. It was still more than a full day but instead of having 50% charge when I turned in, it now often has 40% or 45%.
Anyway, who am I kidding? Better battery life is always desirable.
Pulse Oximeter
This is the killer update. A pulse oximeter, pronounced ok-SIM-eter, measures the degree of oxygen saturation of circulating blood. That’s important because your blood oxygenation needs to be high for you to be healthy. For most, though not all, people, a level of 95% to 100% is normal, and values under 90% are seen as low.
It works, like the heart rate monitor of most trackers and smartwatches, by shining light on your skin and calculating your pulse and what percentage of your red blood cells are carrying oxygen.

Why it’s important just now is because of COVID-19. In some cases, patients who test positive for coronavirus or are presumed positive, but are not sick enough to go to hospital are sent home with a pulse oximeter and told to use it three times a day. That’s because while usually low blood oxygenation levels means someone experiences labored breathing, that’s not always the case with COVID-19.
It’s also useful to athletes to know their blood oxygenation levels.
Apple isn’t first with this feature – Withings had it years ago and will bring it back with its upcoming Withings Scanwatch, while Fitbit already has it in several trackers, though only for measuring oxygenation while you sleep, currently. The Huawei GT 2 smartwatch has a big colorful pulse oximeter app in it.
Anyway, it’s worth having.
S6 chip
Well, this isn’t that much of a surprise, given that the chip is renumbered with each Watch. The S5 is very similar to the S4 chip, but for the addition of a compass, for instance. But this confirms previous rumors, including from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, that the next chip will be much more powerful, allowing advanced features such as the above, to be included.
Mental health abnormalities detection
This is something that Jon Prosser has talked about before and if it sounds confusing it’s not really. Just as the heart rate monitor can spot when your ticker’s working overtime and, if it spots you’re sitting quietly when this happens, will alert you, so the purpose here, it seems is to spot panic attacks from your body’s behavior.
The aim is that it will eventually be able to spot the signs of an impending panic attack before it happens and message you to say that you seem to be getting stressed and would you like to do some breathing exercises to calm you. You can read more about this here.
All of which adds up to an exciting Apple Watch coming later this year. I’ll be covering more leaks and rumors, providing they are persuasive, as they appear. Please check back.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WhatsApp Suddenly Gets Powerful New Security Boost: Here’s Why It Affects You</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The global coronavirus pandemic has distracted everyone, everywhere, but it has not deferred the emotive debate between lawmakers and the technology industry over the future of end-to-end encryption. Governments led by the U.S., U.K. and Australia are battling the industry to open up “warrant-proof” encryption to law enforcement agencies. The industry argues this will weaken security for all users around the world. The debate has polarized opinion and is intensifying.
WhatsApp has proven the most willing, alongside parent Facebook, to fight for encryption in the courts. And so the platform will be massively buoyed by two surprise boosts this week. And that is equally important for the 2 billion users who rely on the platform to secure their messaging. On the assumption you’re among that number, this should really matter to you.
While this debate has been raging for a year, the current “EARN-IT’ bill working its way through the U.S. legislative process is the biggest test yet for the survival of end-to-end encryption in its current form. In short, this would enforce best practices on the industry to “prevent, reduce and respond to” illicit material. There is no way they can do that without breaking their own encryption. QED.
Once the platforms introduce backdoors, those arguing against such a move say, bad guys will inevitably steal the keys. Lawmakers have been clever. No mention of backdoors at all in the proposed legislation or the need to break encryption. If you transmit illegal or dangerous content, they argue, you will be held responsible. You decide how to do that. Clearly there are no options to some form of backdoor.
EFF describes this as “a major threat,” warning that “the privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law enforcement achieves its dream of breaking encryption.” And while all major tech platforms deploying end-to-end encryption argue against weakening their security, Facebook has become the champion-in-chief fighting against government moves, supported by Apple and others.
Most Facebook content is not actually end-to-end encrypted, but it owns WhatsApp which is and has been for many years. WhatsApp popularized this level of security, and now carries more end-to-end encrypted messages than anyone else. The platform confirmed this week that it will continue to fight government attempts to change its security in the courts, ensuring that user security is protected.
That confirmation came as parent Facebook took to the courts in its fight against Israel’s NSO, which it alleges hacked its users, planting spyware on the devices of select targets through WhatsApp. The irony here, of course, is that the security of those users was breached despite end-to-end encryption being in place. WhatsApp has patched several security vulnerabilities in recent months. This was one.
The first surprise for WhatsApp came during the release of documents as part of those court proceedings. It transpires that FBI Director Christopher Wray once argued in favour of WhatsApp’s security when, as a partner with the firm King & Spalding, he “was hired to ‘analyze and protect’ WhatsApp’s software from a Justice Department effort to weaken its encryption in order to conduct wiretap.” The case was unrelated to this current one, but Wray’s name came up when Facebook was arguing for a conflict as regards King & Spalding’s involvement.
The FBI has pointed out that as a lawyer, Wray was hired to advocate for his clients, not to proffer his own opinions. But, even so, the optics are awkward, given that Wray is now a strong advocate of mandated government backdoors. And in that same vein, there has been another surprising twist in favour of end-to-end encryption in the last few days from an unlikely source.
On April 24, the U.S. National Security Agency published an advisory document on the security of popular messaging and video conferencing platforms. The NSA document “provides a snapshot of best practices,” it says, “coordinated with the Department of Homeland Security.” The NSA goes on to say that it “provides simple, actionable, considerations for individual government users—allowing its workforce to operate remotely using personal devices when deemed to be in the best interests of the health and welfare of its workforce and the nation.”
Again somewhat awkwardly, the NSA awarded top marks to WhatsApp, Wickr and Signal, the three platforms that are the strongest advocates of end-to-end message encryption. Just to emphasize the point, the first criteria against which NSA marked the various platforms was, you guessed it, end-to-end encryption.
“End-to-end encryption,” NSA says, “is encrypted all the way from sender to recipient(s) without being intelligible to servers or other services along the way... Only the originator of the message and the intended recipients should be able to see the unencrypted content. Strong end-to-end encryption is dependent on keys being distributed carefully.” So, no backdoors then.
NSA also warns that “no collaboration service can defend against a compromised device—resulting malware infections can access files, keystrokes, contacts, call histories, GPS locations, room audio or camera video (even when not on a call), and most any other information the device observes. Even the most secure collaboration service provides no protection against a compromised device.”
The industry argues that encryption backdoors will result in a weakening of end device security, making it more likely they will be compromised. They also argue that it cannot fall to them to determine good actors from bad—not all governments are forces for good, and who decides how each one should be treated. Messaging platforms are either secure or they’re not. NSA, it would seem, tends to agree.
As uber-secure messaging platform Signal has warned, “Signal is recommended by the United States military. It is routinely used by senators and their staff. American allies in the EU Commission are Signal users too. End-to-end encryption is fundamental to the safety, security, and privacy of conversations worldwide.”
Despite the surprising support WhatsApp—and by default the rest of the industry—has received this week, they remain on the back foot. It is likely that some changes will be legislated and the industry will be forced to compromise. Not good news for those who value their security, especially in these times of increased cyber risk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Businesses Are Using VR To Survive The COVID-19 Era</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COVID-19 has changed life and commerce more than many business leaders predicted. The scar of quarantining and recession will continue to be seen well into the 2020s.
Many businesses across the globe are wondering how much longer they’ll survive the pandemic. Fifty-four percent of small businesses in the U.S. have either temporarily closed or report that they could soon be closing in the coming weeks. And in China, 460,000 businesses have closed permanently within the first quarter alone.
To make it through the pandemic, businesses are embracing digitization more than ever before. Across all industries, increasing numbers of companies are adopting videoconferencing tools and project management platforms to provide their employees with remote work options. Grocery stores are seeing more downloads of their grocery delivery apps. And more universities are offering virtual learning models.
One primary type of technology is jumping back in the spotlight during the pandemic: augmented reality and virtual reality. Here are some ways businesses are using these technologies to survive and thrive during coronavirus.
Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on housing markets and the real estate industry. But with VR, real estate agents and landlords have a golden opportunity to prosper, even during the pandemic.
Chinese startup Beike (Ke.com) has developed VR to let potential buyers and renters take virtual 3D tours of homes and apartments on the market. With almost 4 million houses currently available on its VR platform and 660 million people using it, VR is now an industry disruptor.
The company’s digitization efforts have also led to other efficiencies, including a real estate database that precisely defines housing properties with 433 fields. Its platform enables homebuyers to sign contracts and complete transactions online without breaking quarantine.
The new culture of staying at home is causing unprecedented harm to the $2.5 trillion tradeshow industry. As exhibitions and conferences are being canceled worldwide, the damage is spilling over to other industries — especially hotels, restaurants, and airlines.
While hotels and airlines may have difficulty surviving without massive bailouts, the tradeshow industry can incorporate AR and VR to carry on. No, it won’t exactly be business as usual, but VR-based tradeshows could become even better than what they’ve been in person.
Many companies are using VR platforms that enable participants to join large conferences virtually. Avatars can appear over 360-degree live video feeds. All the knowledge of traditional real-world tradeshows can be shared without breaking quarantine orders.
Because VR-based tradeshows enable participants to join from other countries, this technology will likely stick around long after COVID-19 fears pass. The VR format could also encourage a larger number of experts to speak at conferences because it eliminates travel time, meal costs, and other traditional tradeshow expenses.
Even when consumers purchase products online, they often go to a brick-and-mortar retailer to see the physical products first. But these in-person trips to the store are crumbling under the weight of quarantine orders. The retail industry obviously needs to “innovate or die” as the coronavirus runs its course.
IKEA is using an AR app that lets consumers use their smartphone to see what a piece of furniture will look like in any room of their home. The app even includes a “visual search” capability. A user simply points his phone’s camera at any piece of non-IKEA furniture, and the app searches its database to show the user examples of IKEA furniture that look similar.
Other retailers are using AR to let consumers see what they’d look like wearing a particular piece of clothing or eyeglasses without trying them on in person. Many shoppers are now able to accurately preview themselves in a certain shade of lipstick or hair color before ordering these items online.
There’s no end to the possible use cases for VR and AR during the current pandemic. In healthcare, doctors and surgeons use VR to view detailed scans of a patient’s anatomy without the patient being present. In the education field, classes and labs are increasingly being conducted at a distance, as if the entire class is in the same room. And think of the travel industry, which can offer virtual tours of almost any site or attraction on earth.
The bottom line is that digitization is no longer optional. As society continually changes with new realities like quarantining, only the most innovative businesses are surviving.
It’s crucial to think of ways to bring your customer to your products, even if your customer never leaves her home. It’s also important to think of new ways to virtually bring your employees to work, conferences, and events.
If you can find new ways to deliver value and convenience, all at a distance, you’ll likely thrive as a business operating in the era of COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Facebook Just Gave 200 Million Users A Reason To Quit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Facebook has seen a significant upsurge in traffic during the Coronavirus pandemic, but for any US or Canadian citizens users toying with the idea of deactivating their accounts, Facebook just made it a whole lot easier to pack up and leave.
After a successful trial in Ireland, Facebook has now opened up its Data Transfer Project (DTP) tool to its 200 million-plus users in the USA and Canada. The DTP tool allows users to transfer all of the photos and videos they have currently stored on Facebook directly to Google Photos. This means there’s no longer any need to download individual items one-by-one in order to save them.

With these treasured memories safely archived away from the company’s servers, Facebook loses one big reason users might need to hang on to their accounts. And even if you want to remain on Facebook, it’s always good to have a backup of your data.
How to back up your Facebook photos and videos to Google Photos
It’s easy to get started. just head to the DTP page and choose a destination for the transfer (currently, only Google Photos is supported). In the pop-up window that follows, authorize Facebook’s access to your Google Photos. Then, select either Photos or Videos (for some reason you can’t transfer both at once) and then click ‘Next’. That’s all there is to it.
Note that you may receive a security alert from Google shortly after verification. This is normal.
The process will then run automatically in the background and you can come back to the DTP page at any time to check on its progress. If you decide not to send your information to Google Photos, you can still download your data directly from your browser by clicking on “Download You Information” as before.
The process is still flawed
Unfortunately, the DTP system is far from perfect and suffers from problems in both execution and end result.
When I tried the DTP service with my own Facebook videos, all seemed well initially. There was a delay of a few minutes, and once it started I could watch my transferred videos begin to appear in Google Photos as if by magic. 
But, this success was short-lived. After a few minutes, the transfer stopped abruptly and Facebook provided no troubleshooting information other than showing the status as ‘Failed.’ Attempting to restart the transfer appeared to pick up from where it left off, but even then, those videos that did make it over to Google Photos lacked most of the important associated metadata Facebook stored with them. I wasn’t expecting the original comments and likes to be preserved, but it had also discarded more important details, such as the date and location of capture.
All of the transferred videos were just dumped into Google Photos with today’s date, leaving me to organize them into albums myself and re-set the date information manually. Furthermore, some types of media, such as 360-degree videos, can become corrupted by the transfer. These end up chopped into a 3-by-2 grid of different camera viewpoints in place of the original panorama.
All of this means that, while the service is a good way of preserving access to your photos and video, it’s not a full replacement for the way they are stored on Facebook. That said, if you have been keen to leave Facebook, this still removes a major barrier to doing so.
Note: While Facebook only officially supports its DTP tool in Canada and the US, I found the service worked in the UK. So expect it to roll out to other countries soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Common Mistakes To Avoid When Networking With Executives</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With business people and students working from home, the way in which networking occurs for the near future will likely shift to more phone and Zoom-based calls. There also may be a tighter labor market, making internships and full-time offers more competitive. As a result, students and young professionals have to maximize these networking opportunities. Yet, many do not have the training or experience to know how to manage the networking conversation in a way that motivates an executive to want to help them.
To provide insight on the common mistakes and advice on how to avoid them, I reached out to business people from blue-chip companies (i.e., Fortune 100 size firms) who invest a lot of time networking with business students and young professionals. This is the second part of a two-part series that focuses on advice regarding the do’s and don’ts of networking calls. Make sure to read part one as it provides important insight into what is reasonable to expect from executives and how to network effectively via email.
1. Failing to have an agenda. One individual indicated that in some networking calls, the “awkwardness creeps in right at the point when pleasantries and intros are done, and the conversation needs to switch to the career.” It is at that point that the student (remember the student reached out to the executive) needs to seize control of the conversation just like they would be expected to do as the manager of a brand or business.
2. Failing to be organized and focused. One individual suggested that a common faux pas is failing to be organized and focused. This is similar to the point above – having an agenda – but bears repeating.
The fix: The above individual suggested:“I would advise students to try to be organized about their approach - via prioritization based on: interest, industry, job function, etc. I feel that clustering opportunities by their skill set/stories/transferable skill will help them navigate conversations and focus their research in a more cohesive way since it is difficult to navigate recruiting across multiple types of roles and potentially across industries (especially in a situation where they are scrambling in a time of crisis).” His essential point is to organize your questions in a logical sequence. In combination with the point above, have a clear objective for the call and an organization that enables you to achieve that learning objective in a sequential and logical manner. An additional benefit is that you are demonstrating: preparation, meeting management, ability to generate relevant insight, and so forth—all terrific skills that companies desire.
3. Failing to have enough questions to fill the time. One individual indicated that if after two questions, the young professional says that they only have one more question, this signals a lack of curiosity about the most important brand you’ll ever work on—your own. You want to make sure that you never run out of questions.
The fix: I know what you are thinking right now: “How do I communicate respect for the executive’s time and not overstay my welcome by asking a lot of questions?” The way you do it is to: 1) Communicate that you are nearing the end of the allotted time and you want to be considerate of their time. In some cases, the individual will say that they have more time and you keep going. In other cases, they will say thank you and at this point you pivot and summarize the key takeaways and next steps. 2) Never run out of questions. Always have enough to fill the time (and be prepared should the meeting go long). You should demonstrate your thinking skills through your questions, so take care with developing smart, insightful, questions. Don’t use generic, off-the-shelf questions.
4. Failing to show gratitude and communicate next steps. I’m fortunate that I work at the Darden School of Business, where almost all students know that it is a common courtesy to express gratitude via a thank-you email after somebody has given you the gift of their time and counsel. However, one manager indicated that it is also important to communicate your next steps. As he suggested: “When the person leading the call can recap a conversation to other stakeholders and indicate next steps, it just shows ownership, leadership, and a conviction to get things done. If a student spent (a few) minutes recapping our call with key things we discussed and highlighted a couple next steps they would take, I would be more inclined to help them in the future and maybe even fight for them with our Talent team.”
The fix: Be prepared to summarize—in a short manner—key “takeaways/learning” from the discussion and your next steps. This is a terrific exclamation point to the discussion and sends the executive a message that you listened, internalized the insight, and have a game plan. The benefit, as the executive above suggested—it may motivate them to want to help you even more. Also, always express appropriate gratitude for the time and counsel that the executive provides through a thoughtful and typo-free email/handwritten card. Depending on what you want to achieve, I have found that handwritten thank you cards can: 1) breakthrough the clutter (increasing the likelihood that they are remembered), and 2) help strengthen the message that you are sending about your gratitude. But be thoughtful about when and why you would want to do this. There are times when I use emails to express gratitude and times when it is appropriate to use a more extensive, handwritten card.
5. Failing to understand that networking is about building a relationship, not checking off a phone call. One individual indicated: “95% of the students I have networking conversations with only reach out to me for one call and maybe a follow-up email. If I only talk with you once in September or October, it's hard to remember that conversation when we're deciding on who to extend interview offers to in December.  You need at least 2 strong advocates for you at a company: You want to make the decision to extend an interview offer to you as risk-free as possible. Don't make me have to go out on a limb to advocate for you - you need to be your biggest advocate. Invest the time in a couple of meaningful relationships and it will pay off.”
The fix: Identify a few individuals at your target firms that you really connected with and keep in touch. Importantly, the above individual is on the recruiting team at his firm and so these people make decisions on who they invite for interviews. This is different than connecting with somebody, say a VP, who will not be involved in the recruiting process. You want to try and stay in touch with a couple of folks from the recruiting team (they tend to be more engaged with on-grounds recruiting and the decision makers). You can do this by sharing updates or connecting before a campus visit to see if you can set up time with the manager on grounds. Also, follow signals from the manager. If they suggest that they would like to reconnect in the future, ask them what would be best for them and highlight this in the next steps (and thank you note). Again, you don’t want to be a burden, but staying connected, in a low maintenance manner, can help put you at the top of the manager’s list to recommend.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beware This New Microsoft Teams Password Hacking Threat To 75 Million Users</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Although the likes of Telegram, the secure messenger service with 400 million users, has confirmed it is moving into the video chat space, the most immediate threat to the dominance of Zoom is Microsoft Teams. Especially when it comes to doing business during the work from home transition for so many employees worldwide. This should come as no great surprise, given that the number of daily active users jumped from 44 million to 75 million across just two weeks at the end of March.
A new report reveals how security researchers have observed thousands of cloned Microsoft Team login pages being used in an attempt to harvest account passwords.

At the same time that increasing numbers of prominent organizations have been announcing bans on the use of Zoom, somewhat unfairly in my never humble opinion, so many have been turning to Microsoft Teams instead. This doesn't necessarily mean they are off the cyber-hook when it comes to being attack targets.
Hot on the heels of a report on how Microsoft Teams users were vulnerable to a malicious GIF that could have stolen account data, comes this news of another security threat to those looking for an alternative to Zoom.

The discovery by researchers from Abnormal Security reveals what it says is a multi-prong Microsoft Teams impersonation attack. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an alert dated April 29, warning of just such attack methodology uptick given the speed of deployment as organizations migrate to Microsoft Office 365 during the COVID-19 lockdown. That alert warned how such "hasty deployment can lead to oversights in security configurations and undermine a sound O365-specific security strategy."
In the case of the attacks seen by Abnormal Research, however, neither security configurations nor vulnerabilities in Microsoft Teams were at fault. Instead, what they observed were convincingly-crafted emails impersonating the automated notification emails from Microsoft Teams. The aim, simply to steal employee Microsoft Office 365 login credentials.

To date, the researchers report that as many as 50,000 users have been subject to this attack as of May 1. This is far from your average phishing scam, however, and comes at precisely the right time to fool already stressed and somewhat disoriented workers. Instead of the far more commonly used "sort of look-alike" alerts and notifications employed by less careful cybercriminals, this new campaign is very professional in approach. "The landing pages that host both attacks look identical to the real webpages, and the imagery used is copied from actual notifications and emails from this provider," the researchers said.
The attackers are also using newly-registered domains that are designed to fool recipients into thinking the notifications are from an official source. I recently reported how this tactic is being used by cybercriminals looking to defraud U.S. citizens waiting for their stimulus package payments to arrive. No less than 712 malicious or suspicious stimulus package domains had been registered. Abnormal Security researchers gave the example of a fraudulent domain registered in Panama that included both "SharePoint" and "IRS" in the name to give that air of authenticity to the Microsoft Teams notification email.

As far as the credential-stealing payload is concerned, this is delivered in an equally meticulous way. With multiple URL redirects employed by the attackers, concealing the real hosting URLs, and so aiming to bypass email protection systems, the cybercriminals will eventually drive the user to the cloned Microsoft Office 365 login page.
An example of one such attack was given by the researchers where a document link was provided, that document being located at an unwary email marketing provider site. Within the document was an image asking the reader to log in to Microsoft Teams. Click on the image, and they are deposited at the cloned login page. Another example involved a link hosted on YouTube that redirected twice before landing on the malicious Microsoft Teams credential-stealing site.
"Recipients would be hard-pressed to understand that these sites were set up to misdirect and deceive them to steal their credentials," Abnormal Security said, "given the current situation, people have become accustomed to notifications and invitations from collaboration software providers."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Forget Google—Huawei Plans A Killer New Update To Make Millions Switch Phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This has been a great week for Huawei. It started with the news that it had pulled a masterstroke, securing Here mapping technologies for its phones, a genuine Google Maps alternative. Then came the news that its main Chinese rival in key overseas markets, Xiaomi, was allegedly spying on its users. And finally the smartphone shipment stats for the first quarter confirmed that with its market share in China, it had outpaced Apple to hold the number-two slot, with only Samsung still to catch.
Unfortunately for Huawei, though, none of this will be enough to convince tens of millions of non-Chinese smartphone users to opt for its open-source Android phones, turning away from the familiar world of Google’s software and services. But Huawei has a plan to try to change that. And it has both Google and Apple in mind. And it’s much needed—the company needs to do something to push those millions of users to switch or upgrade to its latest smartphones, despite the loss of Google.
Huawei quickly recognized that the biggest impediment to its international position in a post-blacklist world is competing with Google’s Play Store. Its own AppGallery alternative is now the third largest app distribution platform in the world, but it is still finding its way outside China. The store is no new kid on the block—launched in China back in 2011. But its international version is just two-years old.
So, stepping back, why does Huawei think it can tip the balance in its favour? The answer is clever, albeit highly ironic. And it is an interesting punt with no guarantee of success. In short—security, privacy and, basically, not being Google.
There’s an irony here that is impossible to overlook. Huawei was blacklisted by the U.S. government back in May 2019 over alleged national security concerns. As a consequence, the tech giant lost access to Google for its new phones, causing a major plunge in international sales. Now, its plan is to focus on Google’s security and privacy shortcomings and offer a safer, more secure alternative. You couldn’t make this up—but it’s not as odd as it sounds. Here’s why.
Huawei may be many things, but a data business it is not. Google built Android as a front-end to its globally dominant data machine. Devices, apps and browsers collect and process data, it’s a cash-generating titan. Businesses buy access to map listings, search engine prominence, store windows, raw data for processing ads and outreach. One of the primary issues for Google in losing access to new Huawei devices has been the loss of access to all those consumers. And we know that Apple, which takes a much more restrictive view on the data-monetizing of its users, has seen the value of ads within its ecosystem drop dramatically as a result.
Huawei, by contrast, sells technology: Smartphones and accessories, 5G networking equipment, enterprise infrastructure, surveillance. It can sit back and take a view on the state of the Play Store, the world’s leading app platform, and determine what could and should be done better. Security and privacy quickly come to mind.
From a security standpoint, Google’s challenge is the open nature of Android and the sheer scale of apps available to billions of users around the world. In recent months, the U.S. giant has taken step after step to improve the security screening of apps that find their way into the store, but has been famously unable to match the locked down nature of Apple’s alternative. Just this week, we have seen tworeports surface into Android malware, the problem shows no signs of abating.
Google is always keen to emphasize its ongoing security programs. Again this week the company responded to one of those reports, assuring “we’re always working to improve our detection capabilities. We appreciate the work of the researchers in sharing their findings with us. We’ve since taken action against all the apps they identified.” As for the other report, the malware has not been seen in the wild and so Google takes the view that the threat remains speculative.
But security is an issue that isn’t going away. From nuisance adware to genuinely malicious risks such as the infamous Joker malware, threats continue to escape the net. As to the question is it possible to do better—Apple polices its store with much more rigour. It is not issue free by any extent, but it has proven that by taking a more locked down approach to security you can reduce the issue significantly.
And in this regard, Apple is more a Huawei role model than Google. The Chinese giant will be learning lessons from its American rival, a company the Chinese firm’s founder Ren Zhengfei has said inspired his own business and whose smart devices he and his family use themselves.
Beyond security, we have privacy. And that’s a whole different factor. We all know how much of our data is captured, collected and processed through our phones. they know who and what we know, where we go and why. They are the genuine spies in each of our pockets. This was never more evident than when the U.S. government turned to the marketing industry instead of the mobile networks for data thrown off by our phones for coronavirus population tracking.
Underpinning this privacy issue is the murky world of permissions. Whenever you install an Android app, that app requests and is almost certainly given permissions to access data and functions on your phone. There is staggering abuse of this system by app developers worldwide, some for straight revenue purposes and others for more malicious processing of our data. And while the latter will find themselves kicked from the Play Store if caught, data-based marketing is frowned on but not outlawed. Google uses AI to advise developers if their apps ask for more permissions than their peers, but there’s no enforcement behind this.
At its heart, Google developed and continues to prosper as a data and marketing machine. Its vast ecosystem has grown up around this core tenet. Cue Huawei and the question: can a Chinese company criticized for its data and software security, blacklisted by the U.S., heavily tied into the government in Beijing, do any better?
Well, maybe. Huawei wants its AppGallery to be “open and innovative,” but it also wants to “strictly” protect the security and privacy of users installing apps. How strictly the company deals with developers to resolve issues that plague the Play Store remains to be seen. But Huawei is right in saying it is not “a data company.”
So, what will Huawei do differently?
First, the company plans to verify that developers are who they say they are, with real names disclosed and checked. The company also plans a beefed up security process to do better than Google, rooting out malicious software and vulnerabilities and risks that user data might leak. This includes addressing how apps will run on a Huawei device, taking Apple’s strict approach to sandboxing. Huawei has looked at how it supplements the Android environment to develop and enforce this security layer. Again, you can assume that the company has taken its lead from Apple.
Huawei benefits from control over the hardware and software—again, just like Apple. It can determine where and how credentials are held, it can adopt its own approach to permissions and privacy, it can monitor and control what data is sent to and from a device. The company will also store data regionally, adhering to local regulations, but more importantly telling users that it won’t send data to servers in China—apt given the Xiaomi news broken on Forbes by Thomas Brewster this week.
Can this possibly work? Maybe—but it will be tough, Overcoming resistance to change in key markets as those markets battle COVID-19, and dealing with the brand damage from the blacklist and the building China backlash will be hard. That said, it’s a clever punt, pushing data privacy and security. Huawei will never criticize Google in public, but the backdrop here is to be more like Apple, to take the lack of Google within its own OS as a benefit not a setback. You can expect its marketing to tune to this message as it continues to promote its alternatives.
For Huawei, the clear message here is that if it can’t have Google, it needs to be more like Apple. Making that work will be a mountain to climb, but then Huawei has just heralded its achievements in installing a 5G base station “6,500 meters up Mount Everest.” So, mountain climbing might not be the feat we imagine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here's Everything New On Apple Arcade This Week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Another week, another slew of interesting content on Apple Arcade. Available now are three factory-fresh updates to existing titles and one brand new indie experience that’s sure to leave you feeling something. 
Let's get into it.
First up, we have moody sidescroller Neversong by developer Serenity Forge (Where the Water Tastes Like Wine, Pinstripe), a darkly emotional adventure involving a boy named Peet, a mysterious coma, zombified adults and a haunting place called Blackfork Asylum. 
Oh, there’s also the screaming that, of course, needs investigating.
Yeah.
Boasting what is being touted as a "breathtaking" piano-focused soundtrack, the indie release is supposedly inspired by the developer's terrifying brush with mortality, during which he woke up one night choking on blood. 
A two year hospital stay followed, and because of the ordeal, we now have Neversong. I mean, if that alone isn't reason to check this game out, I don't know what is. From what I can tell, it sort of seems like a mix between Little Nightmares and a Tim Burton short film. 
Looking forward to getting lost in all the doom and gloom.
Then we have updates for Explottens, Redout: Space Assault and Dead End Job. I’ll get out of the way and let the Apple Arcade team do the explaining:
Explottens:“Today, Explottens expands the heart-pumping, hair-raising twin stick arcade shoot ‘em up with a new survival mode. The mode pits players against increasingly difficult waves of enemies and bosses, giving players a fun way to earn coins and upgrade their arsenal to compete with friends, family and other players in the leaderboard.” 
Redout: Space Assault:“The new update ups the ante on fast-paced space combat improving on the battle system including increased speed of player missiles towards their targets, reduced cool down period between missile launches, and increased speed of the player’s ship allowing for more sudden turns and changes of directions. And with the addition of the new Chapter 9, the epilogue in the storyline, players face a challenging final confrontation with the core of the Poseidon fleet, the terrifying Trylobite Capital ship.” 
Dead End Job: “In this “Snacks & Attacks” update, Dead End Job adds 10 new items to the game giving players new collectible weapons and a mix of tasty treats and health items to help Hector Plasm, a worker at Ghoul-B-Gone, to rid haunted offices of unwanted guests.” 
So that’s it for this week. I’m headed over to Apple Arcade to play some Neversong, so let me know if you end up trying it and what you think.
Cheers!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Confirms Cool Galaxy Watch Feature That Outdoes Apple, But There’s A Catch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 is the latest smartwatch from the Korean giant, and is newly released in a cool Under Armour special edition. But the coolest feature has just been confirmed as going live in the coming months. And it’s something that Apple Watch and other smartwatches can’t do. Not even the much-anticipated Withings Scanwatch, which is also superbly versatile can do it.

The new trick the watch can perform is blood pressure monitoring.
Now, if this seems a bit déjà vu, there’s a reason for that. Samsung announced blood pressure monitoring before, promising it for a previous Samsung Galaxy Watch model but it never materialized.
Now, however, Samsung has announced that the Galaxy Watch Active 2 will add blood pressure monitoring later this year, some time between July and October. And after that it will be added to future devices.
This is a big step forward for Samsung’s smartwatch range which, though consistently eye-catching and with blisteringly bright displays, have never caught the imagination like the Apple Watch.
Blood pressure monitoring is a great addition, taking the health capabilities up a level.

But there’s a catch. A couple, actually.
First, it’s only coming to South Korea, because that’s where the country’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has given it clearance. That’s how these things work: when Apple added the capability to take an ECG measurement, it was U.S.-only at first, rolling out to other countries when clearance was granted.
The second catch is exactly how it will work.
Before it can do things accurately, you need to calibrate the Watch sensor using a separate, standalone blood pressure monitor. After that, you simply tap Measure on the watch.
Samsung says:
So, you might ask, why shouldn’t I just use the cuff, seeing as I need to check the result every month? Well, first of all, if this is a metric you are interested in, chances are you may have a standalone cuff already so a once-a-month check-up isn’t arduous.  And, second, for the rest of the month you have the convenience of doing it on your wrist in seconds.
When it will be available elsewhere isn’t clear, though Samsung has said there are no current plans to release it in the U.K., for instance.
It’s a cool addition, cleverly done, and I imagine it’s one of the areas Apple will surely be looking at, too.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Moinet Brings Us Into Outer Space To Save The World Via Innovative Digital Platform</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This past Thursday, independent Swiss watch brand Louis Moinet launched a new website and a truly innovative interactive digital platform to celebrate an event it is calling “Discovery Days.” While other brands are releasing new watches online, and while certain organizers of watch shows that were unfortunately canceled due to COVID-19 are announcing what they call creative digital platforms, Louis Moinet is offering watch lovers and the general public an opportunity to travel into outer space with the brand, to immerse themselves for just a few minutes in a world of science fiction, ancient craftsmanship and visionary thinking.
To execute what is ultimately a deep dive into Louis Moinet’s roots and its creative vision, Jean-Marie Schaller, owner and creative director of the brand, invested in creating a trilogy of films that take us on a journey into outer space to save the world from a dark prince. A truly artistic rather than commercial venture, the films are science-fiction at their finest -- at least when coming from a watch brand.
Even if you are not familiar with the watches created by this brand, many of which boast meteorite dials or have cosmic features, you will love the journey these films take us on. For those who are familiar with the brand, you will notice so many small details that tie back to the company, the collections and the theme behind the brand.
The three short intergalactic films, narrated by Hollywood star Robert Davi, are titled the James’ Odyssey, and each episode is named for a Louis Moinet timepiece. In the first short movie, Space Revolution, James launches into outer space to find a special meteorite that can save the world from the Prince of Darkness. During the second episode, Ad Astra, James struggles against gravity because the Prince has locked him in a black hole. His only way out is black diamond mini ship. The last film, Memoris, shows James’ return to Earth, but the Prince of Darkness isn’t giving up on his dream to destroy the world. In order to halt time, he steals the first chronograph watch ever made — coincidentally — the one created by Louis Moinet.
With an introduction by Schaller, each of the films runs for just a few short minutes, and will take you away from Earth’s current issues and whisk you into a world of adventure and, without realizing it, timekeeping.
The films, though, are just a small portion of what visitors will find on the website During Discovery Days — which will last through May 5th, with some elements living on the website longer. There is section of the site called The Black Book, which is a close-up look at the world of Louis Moinet via a 100-page book that makes its debut on the site (and will later be out in a limited edition in print).
The Black Book traces the history of the brand, from inventing the first chronograph, to creating clocks for Napoleon, and U.S. presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe (this clock is still in the White House today). Through the coffee-table book, visitors can learn of Louis Moinet’s universe of Cosmic art and its mechanical masterpieces.
Born in 1768 and living 85 years, Louis Moinet was a horologist, scholar, painter and more. He was fascinated by the stars and that passion set the tone for his timepieces. Much of this history can be explored via an interactive section of the site, where visitors can enter the museum and pick different rooms to explore, including a legacy room, a chronograph room and a room full of current timepieces.
The site, which features glimpses of yesterday, today and tomorrow — where visitors can explore some of the brand’s creative idea — is truly imaginative and hopefully represents the future of digital platforms for watch brands.
So, what sparked all of this creativity? According to Schaller, “The world is going through difficult times, and during this period, Louis Moinet is offering a chance to explore its historical and creative values. This is an artistic rather than a commercial approach addressed to the whole world while staying at home.”
For those who know Schaller and the current Louis Moinet brand, you will find that this creativity is nothing new for the brand ... it just may be a bit above and beyond.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Is Augmented Intelligence The Best Perspective On AI?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When people think about artificial intelligence, they often think about what intelligence machines can do on their own, without human interaction. However. some of the most powerful and useful AI systems are those that help or augment human capability. The idea of AI systems that augment human ability is known as augmented intelligence. On a recent AI Today Podcast, Professor Tom Davenport from Babson College, senior adviser to Deloitte’s Analytics and AI practices, and fellow of MIT initiative for digital economy shared his perspectives on the power of AI as applied to augmented intelligence.
For over twenty years, Professor Davenport has been a professor, consultant and researcher on various topics, mainly analytics and big data. In addition, Mr. Davenport has written multiple books focusing on analytics, including co-author of “Only Humans Need Apply: Winners and Losers in the Age of Smart Machines", and "The AI Advantage".  As part of writing these books, Davenport interviewed many people who were already using augmented intelligence. 
One interesting insight comes not from AI, but rather from another technology that aimed to replace human activity - the Automated Teller Machine (ATM). When ATM machines were first put into place in the 1980s, there was widespread concern that it would eliminate the jobs of ordinary bank tellers and bank operations. However, according to Davenport, "One of my favorite statistics is that there are roughly the same number of bank tellers now, as there was in 1980 despite all the ATMs, internet banking, and other such changes." From this perspective he sees AI too not having the same sort of disruptive effects on employment as many might at first assume.
From Davenport’s point of view, introducing technology that automates and performs tasks previously accomplished by humans actually creates more jobs for people who take time to learn about how they work. For example, these new machines create opportunities for technicians and programmers and whole new industries that are enabled by new technology. However, he did state "there are some concerns and reasons to not be complacent, reassuring ourselves jobs won't go away and available for everybody may not be true, however, I think most situations will have people working along the machines, if they are willing to learn."
Perspective on Artificial Intelligence
AI and augmented intelligence to be a way to help humans perform better at their tasks, and be more efficient. Therefore, helping people complete a task easier, quicker, and using less energy that can otherwise be spent doing another activity. Professor Davenport sees many ways that AI is helping us to be better at completing tasks or accomplishing goals that are not easy to accomplish otherwise. He states in the inverview,  "Surgical robots are designed to help surgeons with tasks, while surgeons maintain their role." However, he also stated, "I believe at times it will be our responsibility to make the machine work better." Therefore, depending on the situation humans may be dependent upon the machines to help make tasks more efficient. Meanwhile, the machines will need humans for repairs and ensuring they are operating properly. 
In order for artificial intelligence to work properly, it needs good clean data. As such, Professor Davenport believes the role of data scientists are increasingly needed. He wrote an article on the topic with current Chief Data Scientist of the U.S., DJ Patel, called "Data Scientist Sexiest Job of the 21st Century". He interviewed multiple data scientists for the article, stating, "there was not much analytic work taking place, rather it was finding data and cleaning data as that is a major issue for nearly all types of AI." Additionally, Davenport pointed out that "we do not currently have a title for those who specifically work with AI. The role of data scientists was originally to work with data and analytics, and there needs to be a new term for the role of working with AI." Indeed, people are starting to think more about how important data is, and the role of data that is required for AI to work. 
In addition, Davenport has opinions on the role and increasing need for regulation in the context of AI. He believes that there is a role for the federal government to provide in the United States for overall legislation and regulation, but as with most technology-related matters, it really is up to the local states and jurisdictions to put together practical laws and regulations based on how AI will be actually put to use.
In general, Professor Davenport is mostly bullish on the future of AI. He speaks to many executives on the topic, and believes that it is primarily augmented intelligence applications of the narrow AI type that will dominate the sort of applications put into practice. He stats that even  Jeff Bezos of Amazon noted in his 2017 shareholder that the majority of machine learning was quietly improving their processes, rather than high-visibility, glamorous uses of AI. According to Davenport, this is the way to move towards major tasks, minor tasks, and those that just help us live our lives better and more productively.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Blockchain Will Transform The Mobile Phone Industry</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This pandemic has sent our country into a rapid economic downturn with massive job losses and millions of people seeking ways to cut costs. It’s a perfect storm on many fronts leaving consumers mainly focused on indispensable items should as food, shelter and yes communication devices such as mobiles and tablets. These devices have become the ultimate form of communication during this pandemic for news and updates and in many cases the only way family members can communicate with their loved ones. Interestingly PCS Wireless was ahead of itself when a few years ago it invested in the creation of a mobile device ecosystem similar to Carfax called IGWT Block. I recently interviewed its president Flavio Mansi on his vision for this market.
Robert Reiss: Explain your vision to lower mobile phone costs?
Flavio Mansi: Coming from a leading company in the secondary mobile phone business, we recognize the inefficiencies and lack of transparency that plague the industry. Innumerable intermediaries represent touch points throughout the supply chain, adding cost, time and minimal value. In fact, the average delta in value a seller receives compared to the price a buyer pays is currently 50% because of all these intermediaries. In addition, mobile phone grading scales are subjective, non-standardized and inconsistent, at best. 
IGWT Block is launching a blockchain platform called TessaB that will enable every buyer and seller to access detailed data about the devices they are trading, which will drastically reduce the number of intermediaries, and ultimately enable peer-to-peer transactions. Our platform will shed light on the condition of the device, enabling more transparent and secure transactions that save consumers a lot of money.
Reiss: How do you plan to encourage consumers to buy second-hand phones?
Mansi: Our research has found that the main objection consumers have about purchasing pre-owned mobile phones is lack of trust. “How do I know what I am getting,” “What happens if I get a lemon,” “How can I trust what the seller is telling me?” This is similar to how consumers behave when purchasing a used car. By introducing a “Carfax-type” solution, we are leveraging technology that will directly address consumers’ concerns. They will know detailed information about the condition of the mobile device they are purchasing by leveraging the security and immutability of blockchain based smart contracts. Funds paid for a mobile device will not be disbursed to the seller until the buyer receives the device and runs the same diagnostics tests the seller ran. So the transaction is complete only when results of the buyer and seller match.
Reiss: Why would PCS Wireless create IGWT Block, which actually competes with its core business?
Mansi: PCS Wireless was very bold in recognizing that such an inefficient industry is simply not sustainable. Rather than take a back seat and await inevitable developments to arise, the decision was made to innovate and lead the disruption within the industry by investing in a new solution. Rather than competing in PCS’s core business, our goal at IGWT is to reinvent the industry as a whole. Research firm IDC projects the industry to be worth $67 billion globally by 2023.
Reiss: Are you doing anything to help with communication challenges during this pandemic? 
Mansi: We clearly recognize the increased need for people to stay connected. Not only during this terrible pandemic, but throughout the economic impact it will have for time to come. We strongly believe that enabling efficient transactions of mobile devices amongst consumers will lower the barrier to staying connected. Specifically in times of sorrow like these, we are backing our parent company’s partnerships supporting frontline hospital staff, patients, and seniors. This includes our partnership with NJII to connect PCS Wireless to the right people at New Jersey hospitals. We have also teamed up with Covid Tech Connect to service the national network of hospitals. In addition, the Covid Tech Connect initiative is leveraging our global supply chain to source items overseas to connect those in need with loved ones, both locally and overseas.
Reiss: How do you see the transformation of the mobile supply chain working on a blockchain?
Mansi: Bringing transparency to the supply chain will make it much more efficient. Currently an average of 7 intermediaries touch a pre-owned mobile phone from its original owner to its new ultimate owner. These intermediaries are often located around the globe, so the mobile device at issue travels the world during this highly inefficient journey. 
By providing access to a shared database, our blockchain platform will enable localized transactions. Think of it as decentralized inventories. If a seller in Oklahoma City wants to sell its iPhone 8 and there is a buyer 6 miles away, why do we need to transport that iPhone 8 from the Verizon store in Oklahoma City where the seller drops it, to Verizon’s triage warehouse in Dallas, to a wholesale buyer in New Jersey, to a wholesale seller in Hong Kong, to an etailer in Maryland, where the buyer purchases it and is shipped to Oklahoma City? Sounds insane because IT IS!  Watch how the TessaB ecosystem will work.
Reiss: Is IGWT currently selling these mobile phones today?
Mansi: As part of our strategy we developed a “proof of concept” business in parallel to the build out of our blockchain platform. To that effect we launched our e-commerce site, Glyde.com, where, today, consumers can purchase Premium Pre-Owned phones, accidental damage protection plans under our TessaB Protect brand, and accept phone trade-ins for cash or credit. Over the next 18 months we will be rolling out more TessaB powered offerings powered by the Blockchain, so stay tuned!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kioxia Introduces Software Enabled Flash</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kioxia (formerly known as Toshiba Memory) announced the introduction of Software-Enabled Flash (SEF).  Kioxia says that, “SEF… combines software flexibility, host control and flash native semantics into a flash native API and purpose-built controller. Targeted to data center directors, architects and developers, SEF technology makes flash easier to manage, more timely to deploy and more predictable in nature – putting the power in programmers’ hands.”
The flash native API (which Kioxia says will be available this Summer) can be used to simultaneously implement multiple protocols in a flash memory device.  An SSD or parts of an SSD can provide Zoned Name Spaces as well as block access to data.  Kioxia says that this approach will be open source and available to any flash memory supplier to enable flash storage devices what can execute the API.  The figure below shows the hardware module and software development kit for SEF.
SEF is built with the needs of hyperscaler’s in mind.  Hyperscalers want access to block as well as page level data in order to manage data placement and to control latency.   SEF includes a small special purpose media-centric flash controller that enables new features such as advanced die time scheduling and access to all the flash memory cells.  
SEF enables system architects at hyperscale companies to freely and flexibly define storage access between the host and the flash memory.  The API enables quick changes by system developers and abstracts flash memory generational changes, since these architects don’t have to modify code for each new generation of flash memory.
The controller includes various means to increase QLC endurance as well as to manage error recovery and defect management.  The controller exposes low level management that enables total control over data latency.  The open sourced API and associated libraries work with accelerators that can off-load functions from a CPU to the flash controller.  This technology will further enable composable infrastructure, as the storage controller can provision storage infrastructure on the fly.
Kioxia demonstrated simultaneous operation of several protocols in a single SSD using an FPGA platform.   The demonstration included operation of ZNS, SEF native, TRocksDB, Firecracker and a custom hyperscale flash translation layer.  The company plans to go to an ASIC with conventional silicon to implement all of these capabilities later this year.  Kioxia will be talking about this technology at the virtual Open Compute Summit next week. 
Kioxia’s software enabled flash combined with an open source API enables storage system architects and in particular, hyperscale data center designers, to gain unprecedented access and management of flash memory.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Confirms Cool Galaxy Watch Feature That Outdoes Apple, But There’s A Catch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3 update below. This post was originally published on May 2, 2020.
Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 is the latest smartwatch from the Korean giant, and is newly released in a smart Under Armour special edition. But the coolest feature has just been confirmed as going live in the coming months. And it’s something that Apple Watch and other smartwatches can’t do. Not even the much-anticipated Withings Scanwatch, which is also superbly versatile, can do this. The new trick the watch can perform is blood pressure monitoring.

Now, if this all seems a bit déjà vu, there’s a reason for that. Samsung announced blood pressure monitoring before, promising it for a previous Samsung Galaxy Watch model but it never materialized.
May 3 update: There’s now even more known in the way of health advances on their way in the Galaxy Watch Active2, and further Galaxy Watch hardware predicted to be coming soon.
The Galaxy Watch Active2 will, just like the Apple Watch Series 4 and 5, measure an ECG on your wrist. Although this feature was announced as part of the watch’s capabilities at launch, it has yet to work. That was also Apple’s experience with ECG as there are two parts to the equation: clearance by the relevant health authority and finessing the software on the Watch. In Apple’s case it’s believed that final clearance for ECG was only achieved hours before the feature was announced, and the feature finally went live a few months later in the U.S., followed by the U.K. in Spring 2019. It’s still rolling out to other territories.
Samsung hasn’t given an exact date for ECG going live on the Galaxy Watch Active2, saying that it was aiming for the first quarter of 2020, but later admitting it wouldn’t make that deadline. So, like blood pressure monitoring, it’s coming but not yet actually usable.
Perhaps by the time the feature is active, new Samsung watches will be with us. Chinese regulators have certified two Samsung upcoming devices whose codenames have been leaked: SM-R840 and SM-R850. These could be the Galaxy Watch 2 or Galaxy Watch Active3, if Samsung sticks with the current naming approach. It’s likely that whether it’s Watch 2 or Active 3 that it will come in two case sizes.
Samsung has announced that the Galaxy Watch Active 2 will add blood pressure monitoring as an active, usable feature later this year, some time between July and October. And after that it will be added to future devices.
This is a big step forward for Samsung’s smartwatch range which, though consistently eye-catching and with blisteringly bright displays, have never caught the imagination like the Apple Watch.
Blood pressure monitoring is a great addition, taking the health capabilities up a level.

But there’s a catch. A couple, actually.
First, it’s only coming to South Korea, because that’s where the country’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has given it clearance. That’s how these things work: as mentioned above, when Apple added the capability to take an ECG measurement, it was U.S.-only at first, rolling out to other countries when clearance was granted.
The second catch, arguably more important, is exactly how it will work.
Before it can do things accurately, you need to calibrate the Watch sensor using a separate, standalone blood pressure monitor. After that, you simply tap Measure on the watch.
Samsung says:
So, you might ask, why shouldn’t I just use the cuff, seeing as I need to check the result every month? Well, first of all, if this is a metric you are interested in, chances are you may have a standalone cuff already so a once-a-month check-up isn’t arduous.  And, second, for the rest of the month you have the convenience of doing it on your wrist in seconds.
When it will be available elsewhere isn’t clear, though Samsung has said there are no current plans to release it in the U.K., for instance.
It’s a cool addition, cleverly done, and I imagine it’s one of the areas Apple will surely be looking at, too.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You would think with all the noise about Tesla that the average American’s take on the electric car would have changed.
But the basic sentiment hasn’t shifted since 1997, according to the J.D. Power 2020 Q1 Mobility Confidence Index.
Longstanding barriers: charging, range, and price
The availability of charging stations, driving range, and price are still the top 3 barriers to electric vehicles as perceived by American and Canadian consumers, the April report said, which is based on a SurveyMonkey sampling.
In fact, things haven’t changed since 1997, when the General Motors EV1, the progenitor of the mass-market electric car, was launched, the report said.
The report continued. “Vehicle technology and infrastructure availability have progressed dramatically in 23 years, but consumers have not budged in their perception.”
And these barriers also apply to those who have owned an EV previously, the report said.
Tesla owners are still a tiny minority
Though not covered in the report, Tesla owners and fans are still a tiny minority of the American car-buying public, despite the high profile of the electric carmaker and CEO Elon Musk.
And owners of EVs like the Chevy Volt, Chevy Bolt, and Nissan Leaf are an even tinier minority in the U.S.
If you need proof, look no further than your nearest highway, which, in 2020, is almost all gas cars. Ditto on car dealerships.
More EV reality checks in the report
“Few consumers have any experience with battery-electric vehicles,” the report said, adding that “the majority (70%) of American respondents have never been in a battery-electric vehicle, and 30% say they know nothing about them.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">To help raise funds for the International Rescue Committee and their efforts in combatting COVID-19 in vulnerable communities, Sotheby’s has teamed up with Google to host a sale of virtual experiences. And there are some incredible virtual experiences to bid for, from recording a song with Sting, to an online makeup tutorial with Charlotte Tilbury, hang out with Sacha Baron Cohen, have a cooking lesson with Heston Blumenthal and even take tea (virtually) with Hillary Clinton.
“Sotheby’s has a long tradition of supporting charitable organizations in times of need. We are proud to bring our centuries of experience and the power of our online auctions to bear against the impact of COVID-19. With the partnership of Google and so many leading figures who have pledged to support this unique venture, we hope to be able to deliver meaningful resources for the extraordinary efforts of the International Rescue Committee, needed now more than ever.”Charles Stewart, CEO of Sotheby’s
Bidding has just commenced and will be live until 8 May, and not only has every experience been offered without reserve, winning bidders also have the option to share their experience with frontline workers and others who have been directly impacted by COVID-19.
"Apollo was the moment of our cosmic birth, ‘our’ meaning all of us, and it is that scale of being, all of us, who are simultaneously and virtually without exception being existentially challenged. And indeed, we clearly see that we are all responsible for one another, in very immediate ways.”
When asked what does he find comfort in when faced with catastrophe, Rusty says, “My sense of identity with the Universe, the sense I have that we humans, we life here on Earth, are part of a great universal process.” Russell 'Rusty' Schweickart
“As a global community we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain and millions of refugees and displaced people are now facing a double emergency with the virus reaching their communities. With those most vulnerable in need of all the help that we can give, we would like to thank Sotheby’s, Google and all the luminaries who have agreed to participate and donate their time for this auction in support of IRC’s front-line efforts to help stop the spread of Covid-19 in vulnerable communities around the world.” David Miliband, President & CEO of The International Rescue Committee
The below experiences are available with more added throughout the week:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft Just Dealt A Blow To Google Chrome With These New Security Features</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft’s Edge browser is getting increasingly popular as a valid alterative to Google Chrome. Like Chrome, Edge is based on the Chromium browser engine, and it comes with a bunch of pretty cool features to boot. 
As a huge number of people work from home during the COVID-19 crisis, Microsoft is about to add some more new features to Edge to make it more secure for those staying away from the office.
The first change is an update to Microsoft Edge’s “Profiles” feature to make it easier for you to separate work and personal browsing. In a blog, Microsoft announced a feature called “Automatic Profile Switching” to help keep work and personal data separate.
Available in Microsoft Edge 83, people who use multiple profiles can check it out by trying to navigate to a site authenticated with a work account while in their personal profile.

To help stop you getting mixed up, Microsoft will detect this is happening and prompt you to switch to your work profile to access the site without you having to authenticate to it.
“We hope that this will help you keep your work and personal data separate and help you get to your work content more seamlessly,” said  Avi Vaid, Microsoft Edge program manager.
And that’s not all. Another update coming to Microsoft Edge could make it easier for you to avoid malicious sites and files while working remotely. That’s according to tech site Bleeping Computer, which says Microsoft is also testing a new version of Edge that comes with new features including an update to a feature called SmartScreen that stops you from visiting insecure websites or downloading malicious files. The feature works by checking the file or site against a database to check it’s safe. 
SmartScreen is being updated in Microsoft Edge Dev v 84.0.495.2 to support two new technologies ClickOnce and DirectInvoke so it can block a much bigger range of malicious documents.
During COVID-19, software releases have been delayed and cancelled as browser makers focus on keeping products as secure as possible. Google Chrome releases were initially paused, but then restarted and Chrome 82 skipped altogether. 
Because Microsoft Edge is based on the same Chromium browser engine, Microsoft did the same and also skipped version 82. Version 81 has been available since mid April, and Microsoft Edge 83 will be released early in mid-May.  
As many of us continue to work from home, the new Edge features will certainly come in handy. So if you’re looking for a Google Chrome alternative, perhaps Microsoft Edge could be it.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3 update below. This post was originally published on April 30, 2020.
The next Apple software release looks like being iOS 13.5. Previously, fellow Forbes writer Anthony Karcz unveiled the update and gave us a useful rundown of all that’s new, which you can read here.
MORE FROM FORBESThese 5 Cute Little iOS Tricks Have Transformed How I Use My iPhoneBy David Phelan
Until it was revealed, by the way, we thought it was going to be called iOS 13.4.5, but because of an update to the iOS software developer kit, with the important addition of the API (application programming interface) for tracing contacts exposed to COVID-19, it was renumbered iOS 13.5. There are a range of new features, which in itself is rare at this stage in the iOS cycle, and the contact-tracing is easily the most important. But another one also stands out: the improvement to Face ID in the wake of an increasing number of people wearing face masks.
May 3 update: Apple and Google are expected to show sample apps for exposure notification as early as next week, made possible thanks to the API found in this iOS 13.5 update.
That’s according to CNBC in a report which also reveals the latest from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). CNBC says the new CDC document leaves the door open to the Apple/Google project.  
The CDC has issued a new document which specifies how digital contact tracing apps should work, with minimum and preferred criteria. The Apple and Google exposure notification system, part of the API in this iOS update, as mentioned below, aligns pretty well with CDC requirements, meaning it’s likely that a lot of local health authorities will want to adopt it.
After all, although Apple and Google’s system does a lot of the heavy lifting that is helpful for creating an app, health authorities can go their own ways as well. For instance, the British National Health Service is making clear that it has plans for a different model for its forthcoming contact-tracing app. The British cyber-security centre, GCHQ has also been involved in creating the British app. It will use Bluetooth transmissions, just as the Apple and Google set-up does, but a big difference is the U.K. app will use a centralized model, so matching contacts who have been exposed to COVID-19 will be done from a central server.
To be clear, the new advice from the CDC does accept that a centralized system is acceptable as well, but that the preference is for decentralized. Stay tuned for more details on the first apps made possible with the new API, and for the public release of iOS 13.5 in coming weeks or even days.
Back to why the new software is needed so urgently.
Face ID
As Anthony touched on briefly, Face ID has been upgraded so that it’s easier to use when you’re wearing a face mask.
If you’ve been wearing a face mask, you’ll know how annoying it is to have to pull the mask down when you’re paying at the register.
It’s not impossible to make Face ID work with a face mask now, but it’s a bit fiddly as it requires you training Face ID to recognize you with the mask on as an alternate option to one with the face mask off.
And even then, it may not work.
Now, though, Apple has come up with a simple but clever fix which, it’s important to note, doesn’t make Face ID any less secure than it is now. No surprise there, Face ID stands out among facial recognition systems across all portable devices, so Apple isn’t going to sacrifice that security level for anyone.
Apple has stressed that this new system retains the one million to one chance of a random person in the population being able to spoof your iPhone into thinking they are you.
Here’s how the new feature works.
MORE FROM FORBESMove Over, AirPods Pro: Noise-Canceling In-Ear Headphones Unveiled At Killer PriceBy David Phelan
Normally, when you double-press the side button to launch Face ID, the iPhone scans your face and if it doesn’t recognize you, shows the passcode field. But it takes a few seconds for this to happen which, with the line behind you (standing six feet apart, of course) may be getting impatient.
With iOS 13.5, the moment Face ID is invoked and the iPhone recognizes that there’s a face mask in play, it automatically presents the passcode field, instantaneously. No waiting needed for the crowd in line behind you.
This will work for unlocking the iPhone, authenticating an App Store purchase, buying an Apple Books title, Apple Pay, of course, and iTunes.
Crucially it will also work with all other apps where signing in with Face ID is supported.
It’s hard to imagine a more timely update. Most urgently, iOS 13.5 features the API for exposure notification, for COVID-19 contact tracing devised by Apple and Google in an unprecedented collaboration.
So, the next update really can’t come soon enough. If you can’t wait, you can always join the public beta, but my guess is that it will be with us very soon.
Please check back as I’ll be covering iOS 13.5 in full detail as soon as it appears.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Confirms New Galaxy Fold, Note Smartphones In Q1 Results</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">05/03 Update below. This post was originally published on April 30
Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 looks like one of the year’s best smartphones, and now the company has suddenly confirmed its release. 
MORE FROM FORBESSamsung Galaxy Note 20: Everything We Know So FarBy Gordon Kelly
In a surprising development, Samsung used its Q1 Financial Results to confirm not only the release of the Galaxy Note 20 (renders via LetsGoDigital), but the Galaxy Fold 2. The company states that they are “for the second half” of the year and it made a point of referring to them as “differentiated products in the premium segment” which makes sense, given the Fold’s folding display and the Note 20’s radical S Pen revamp. 
ZDNet reported that Samsung may use its Exynos processor instead of Snapdragon in the upcoming Galaxy Note series. Due to the Coronavirus situation, the production of the Snapdragon 865+ processor seems to be uncertain. So, Samsung is planning to release the upcoming Note series with the new Exynos 992 processor which is built on the 6nm process to offer better power/performance ratio when compared to the current Exynos 990 processor.
It’s worth pointing out that the time frame makes perfect sense, new Notes typically launch August - October, but Samsung confirming the phones on the record in April is a shock. Interestingly, Samsung also stated that it “plans to enhance product competitiveness by expanding 5G adoption to mass-market smartphones and improve operational efficiency across all areas throughout R&D, production, supply, channel and marketing.”
For smartphone buyers at lower price points, this is great news. But it’s also a fascinating insight for buyers at the high end, given the addition of 5G forced Samsung to substantially increase prices of the Galaxy S20 range, which now starts at $999 and rises to $1,399. Consequently, commoditization should have a positive impact on the price of both the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Fold 2. They will need to. 
For Note fans, we also know there’s a lot more to look forward to, including next-gen OLED panels, faster memory, dramatically faster storage, new biometrics, the aforementioned S Pen changes and a surprise chipset upgrade. 
With Apple also planning a war on price, it looks like the big winner here will be all of us.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Two Key Improvements Made The 2020 Dell XPS 13 9300 Better</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The XPS 13 has become the gold standard for 13-inch laptops but I had two gripes that Dell has finally fixed: sound and face ID.
Two things that needed fixing:
—Sound:
The XPS 13 9300 now has a solid sound system (and same for the Dell XPS 13 7390 and 7390 2-in-1). Both the XPS 13 and XPS 15 for too long had tinny sound that was, to be blunt, awful.
The XPS 13 9300 now has both good bass and mid-range and gets loud without distortion.
And the Waves MaxxAudio equalizer, which was preinstalled on my system, is a essential part of getting great sound from the XPS. Make sure this is running on your XPS 13.
—Face ID:
The XPS 13 has been a thin-display-bezel trend setter. That’s important because it reduces the overall size of the laptop making it more portable as well as more aesthetically appealing.
But there was one thing missing: a Windows Hello Face ID (facial recognition) camera in the top bezel. That’s there now without sacrificing any thinness. (The 9300 also has a fingerprint reader built into the power button.)
And one more thing...
While this isn’t something that was lacking necessarily in previous versions of the XPS 13, Dell also updated the display to 13.4 inches from 13.3 inches and upped the resolution on both the standard display from FHD to FHD+ (1,920-by-1,200) and the 4K display from UHD to UHD+ (3,840-by-2,400).
Everything else:
Dell is in an enviable position of pursuing perfection with the XPS 13. It’s a gorgeous laptop that equals or exceeds everything you expect in a best-of-the-best laptop on every metric including performance, display, and keyboard.
Now that Dell has mastered the 13-inch laptop, it is apparently aiming to do the same thing with the upcoming 2020 15-inch XPS 9500 and 17-inch XPS 9700, which are reportedly imminent.
——
Notes:
I typically have a stable of 10 - 15 new laptops I’m testing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here’s Everything Coming To Netflix —And Everything Leaving—In May 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Happy May Day!
Actually, these days every day feels like May Day—at least in the sense that we are all shouting a collective “May day! May day!” as the entire globe spins into economic recession amidst the coronavirus pandemic. May day! May day! The planet is going down!
Distraction is key, I’ve found, to maintaining a relatively sane life in lockdown. One must social distance, wash one’s hands and all the rest, but that does not mean one must be bored. Along with some healthy exercise, a good book or twenty, and a mix of board and video games, streaming Netflix makes for a wonderful diversion.
May brings with it a number of new Netflix Originals and a bunch of other content, from movies like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Back to the Future, to shows like The Flash Season 6 and Riverdale Season 4.
The two shows I’m most excited about are Avatar: The Last Airbender, which drops all of its three seasons on May 15th, and Space Force which lands on May 29th.
The Last Airbender is one of my favorite animated family shows of all time, hands down. I have nothing but fond memories of watching this with my family and then moving on to The Legend Of Korra, and then even more recently the Netflix Original The Dragon Prince from the lead writer of The Last Airbender, Aaron Ehasz. If you haven’t watched these shows, please do—whether or not you have kids.
Space Force is a new Netflix Original Comedy from Steve Carell and The Office co-creator Greg Daniels. It’s about President Trump’s new military branch, Space Force, and stars Carell as its new chief. If it can capture that old Office charm, or even a fraction of it, we’re in for a treat.
Here’s everything coming to Netflix in May. Scroll down further for everything leaving the streaming service.

Not as many titles are leaving Netflix as there are new ones arriving, which is a good thing. But there are some worth pointing out.
Outbreak (pictured above) is on its way out at the end of May. I note this because it’s a movie about a deadly virus which seems . . . timely, if you will. I saw it ages ago and liked it a lot but I’m not sure how well it’s aged. I should give it another go before it leaves Netflix.
John Carter is a much underrated space-and-planet sci-fi/fantasy movie from Disney that completely bombed at release but which I have a fond spot for. It heads to Disney Plus today.
Then there are the Austin Powers movies, the Final Destination movies, and a couple Naked Gun films all heading out at the end of the month. Here’s the full list:
Leaving May 1
John Carter
Leaving May 15

Update 5/3
Now that we’re a couple days into the month I thought I’d update this post with some discussion of the first big Netflix Original to land in May: Hollywood.
Hollywood is a new big-budget TV show from writer/producer Ryan Murphy. It’s a revisionist take on post-WWII Hollywood where equality and acceptance aren’t quite so hard to come by. It’s an odd approach to portraying the very real struggle many of these people faced, so it’s no wonder it’s getting a mixed reception.
Murphy’s past TV credits include:
In other words, Murphy is behind a lot of big hits and popular TV shows. I’ve only just started watching The Politician, another Netflix Original, and so far it’s outstanding. I’ve only watched the first episode, however, so I can’t judge—and that show has fared even worse on RT with a “rotten” 57% aggregate.
Hollywood is getting mixed reviews as well. I still need to give it a shot and will update when I have, but right now the show is “Fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes but only just, clocking in at 60%.
Brian Tellerico at RogerEbert.com gives it just one star, writing “Much like Quentin Tarantino did in “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,” Murphy blends actual history with his widely revisionist view of it, but the result isn’t as poignant as Tarantino’s, instead coming off as simple-minded and cruel.”
He concludes that Murphy “has created some of the most complex and nuanced takes on acceptance that have been on TV in the last two decades. It just feels like he got caught up in his own vision here, seduced by the lights of Hollywood into creating something with no consistent tone or vision.”
Cary Darling of the Houston Chronicle writes that “Murphy and co-creator Ian Brennan's desire to have "the good guys" win in this fictionalized Hollywood is so at odds with what really happened that it goes beyond fantasy and fairy tale into fever dream.” Darling gives the show three out of five stars.
John Doyle of the Globe and Mail is more upbeat. “You will like that myth or be put off by its sometimes stirring sincerity,” he writes. “It floats airily and compels, then shifts to anger. Either way, you'll know you're watching something unique and thought-provoking. Bravo to all involved.”
Whatever the case, the show appears delightfully divisive. I look forward to starting it. If you’ve watched Hollywood, be sure to let me know your thoughts on the new Netflix Original on social media.
P.S. Hollywood is faring slightly better on IMDB where it’s currently averaging 7.5/10, the exact same score as The Politician.
And that’s all folks!
What are you looking forward to on Netflix this May? Anything you recommend?
Let me know on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft Issues Windows 10 Update Warning</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft has recently hinted at big changes coming to Windows 10 updates, but that doesn’t help the here and now - especially after a rottenrun ofbadupdatesrecently. And now Microsoft has warned you must be alert again. 
MORE FROM FORBESHow To Upgrade To Windows 10 For 'Free' In 2020 [Updated]By Gordon Kelly
Picked up by Windows Latest, Microsoft has confirmed that its “new final build” of the big Windows 10 May 2020 Update is ready but it will ship with several known issues. 
The company warns that after the update, Windows 10 users will find Windows Mixed Reality, its platform for virtual and augmented reality applications with more than 2,500 games and VR experiences, “may not work correctly for many users”. In addition, its DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tool has problems whereby it may not report the correct status when repairing corruption on systems, and there are issues with text entry in some niche cases. 
The good news is Microsoft is working on fixes and, unsurprisingly, it is making fixes for Windows Mixed Reality a priority “which we hope to release in early May.” Despite this, Microsoft will continue the rollout of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update and anyone who checks for updates (Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update) will receive it. 
What does the May 2020 update bring? It’s mostly tweaks and fixes (aside from the things Microsoft knows it breaks) along with upgrades to the Windows Subsystem for Linux and graphical improvements to the Settings and Task Manager user interfaces. So yes, it isn’t essential and I would advise mainstream users stay away from it right now. 
Microsoft does have (overdue) plans to improve Windows 10 updates, but with the platform recently passing one billion installations, the vast majority of users would be wise to remain cautious.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Surprisingly Simple Email Trick Will Stop Spam With One Click</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some 320 billion spam emails are sent every day, and 94% of malware is delivered via this medium. What if I were to tell you a surprisingly simple one-click email trick could stop them?
Over half of all global email traffic is spam, a statistic that is only surprising in as far as most people probably expected it to be more than that. To put that into some perspective, the latest analysis from Cisco Talos intelligence puts the average daily spam volume for April at 320 billion.
Spam is always annoying, sometimes amusing and often dangerous. According to Google, its Gmail service blocks more than 100 million phishing emails every single day, 18 million of them related to COVID-19 in some way. With as much as 94% of malware being delivered by email, and one in every 3,000 email messages containing malware payloads, spam remains a very real problem in 2020.
But what if I were to tell you a surprisingly simple email trick could stop that spam with just one click?
The history of spam is a long and dishonorable one. I'll skip the email advertisement sent to a couple of hundred users of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), a technical precursor to the internet as we know it, back in 1978. Instead, I had to wait until April 1994 before receiving my first spam message: sent to USENET groups rather than by email, advertising a green card lottery service by two lawyers, Canter and Siegel.
It was this simple advertising message that formed the foundation of what became the junk email phenomenon. That danger was demonstrated almost precisely 20 years ago to the day when the ILOVEYOU worm was distributed by email and infected millions of Windows computers. Across the two decades that have followed, spam has remained the primary vehicle for delivering malware as well as being an ever-present irritant.

Twenty years ago, spam blacklists were the most commonly used anti-spam technique: and oh boy did they suck. Filtering spam by the IPs of known bad senders only works if those IPs are not only known but accurate. Seeing as many spammers used the same internet service providers as everyone else, false positives were the order of the day and most of us turned such filtering firmly off soon enough.
Dedicated spam filtering solutions using a combination of sender reputation scoring and keywords soon emerged and proved more effective. They did, however, require a period of training whereby the recipient would have to categorize email as being spam or not manually.
Thankfully, email applications now come with anti-spam measures built-in, and the likes of Gmail, for example, reckon the machine learning algorithms that power the spam filtering for 1.5 billion Google email users are 99.9% accurate. That still leaves way too many actual spam messages getting through when you do the math, and it's dealing with these that is proving difficult. A new one-click email trick that is currently being tested by Mozilla could provide the solution for 250 million Firefox users.
Going by the name of Private Relay, Mozilla is currently testing a new add-on for Firefox users that could put an end to unwanted emails using a single click. The idea behind the new add-in is undoubtedly not new. Still, Mozilla is making it so easy to use that it could revolutionize the way we deal with unwanted, annoying and potentially dangerous emails.
That idea is email aliases, where you create different email addresses for services and sites that you sign up to while keeping your "real" email to yourself. Gmail users, for example, might sign up with e.xample@gmail.com instead of example@gmail.com as a 'dot' before the @ symbol doesn't change where the email ends up, but does help to identify where spam is coming from. But that's not as easy to manage as the Firefox solution.
By simply clicking on a "relay" button next to the email fields, once installed, the add-on will allow an alias to be created on-demand. All emails sent to that new address will automatically be forwarded to your actual address. Mozilla describes the Private Relay Firefox add-on as being able to generate "unique, random, anonymous email addresses that forward to your real address," and when done with you can "disable or destroy the email address."

This user interface is what makes Private Relay so simple, and so powerful: removing the alias means that no further emails will be received, all spam will be terminated from that sender and any others they might have shared your address with.
If a service you are using suffers a data breach and logins appear on the dark web, a would-be attacker wouldn't have your email address for use in executing a credential stuffing attack. "We all make many online accounts, but most of them are linked to 1 or 2 of our email addresses," Mozilla said, "this means if just one account is hacked or tracked, every other account and its associated data is now also at risk."

Ah, yes, the catch. There's always a catch. In the case of Mozilla's Private Relay, it's merely that it is still in testing mode at the moment, an invite-only alpha testing mode. That will change in due course, and by keeping an eye on the Private Relay pages you will be able to sign up to the waiting list and join in "soon," according to Mozilla.
You might also think for old-timers like me who have had the same very public email address for more than 20 years, then maybe it's a little late to start using aliases, but think again. It's never too late to start dealing more effectively with the problem of spam. I'll be front and center of the queue to test this one when the testing expands.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Body Language Hacks To Project Leadership Presence On Zoom</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As more interactions move from in-person environments to online events, your ability to project virtual leadership presence is quickly becoming the key to your continued success.
Whether you are interviewing for a new job, presenting to the executive team, or facilitating a team meeting, you are the most influential when you express your core values and show up as your best authentic self — so the most powerful body language advice I can give you is to believe in yourself, trust your instincts, and allow your natural friendliness, compassion, and credibility to shine through.
There is, however, added value in knowing which of your body language habits is reinforcing people’s positive perception of you as a leader — and which habits may be sending the wrong message.
Here are body language hacks for your next Zoom event:
Make a positive first impression
Just as in a physical meeting, first impressions matter. It takes less than seven seconds for people to make judgments about your attitude, level of confidence, professional status, and personal warmth. While a face-to-face meeting gives you added opportunities (entering the conference room, shaking hands with an interviewer, greeting individual members at a team meeting, etc.), on a computer screen, it’s only your visual image that sets that initial impression.
• Take a few minutes before your meeting starts to think about what you want to accomplish, why it’s important to the attendees, and why you are personally invested in the topic of this event. Doing so will help your facial expressions and initial gestures to automatically align with your intent.
• Dress for virtual success by avoiding clothing with tight patterns, as they “jump around” on camera. Solid colors work best. If it’s appropriate for the event, your outfit can be very casual, as long as you make sure that your grooming and wardrobe reinforce your professional image.
• Right before the meeting or interview begins, take five deep breaths. This silent breathing technique is a secret weapon of all on-camera hosts and presenters to help them get centered and focused.
• Start with a smile. Some nonverbal behaviors can bring out the best in us. Smiling is one of them, as it directly influences how other people respond. When you smile at someone, in person or virtually, they almost always smile in return. And, because facial expressions trigger corresponding feelings, your smile makes you and your audience feel more upbeat and positive.
Realize which nonverbal habits get in your way
The impact of your nonverbal behavior relies less on what you mean by the signal you send — and more on what the observer thinks you mean. That’s why you need to realize how your body language is most likely being read. And, by the way, since the human brain pays more attention to negative messages than it does to positive ones, what people unconsciously look for and react to the most, are signs that you are in a bad mood, fearful, unsure, or upset.
Here are a few body language habits that can send the wrong message:
• You may be more comfortable with your arms crossed, but crossing arms is almost always perceived as a closed sign of resistance.
• You may naturally slump when seated, but when you collapse in your chest and round your shoulders, you minimize your leadership presence by appearing less confident and competent than you really are.
• When we’re nervous, we all tend to pacify with some form of self-touching or soothing behavior such as rubbing hands together, drumming fingers, playing with jewelry, twirling hair, fidgeting, rocking or swaying. When you exhibit any of these pacifying gestures virtually, they get amplified and people begin to wonder why you’re so nervous.
• You (like I) may habitually talk using a lot of hand motion. But sweeping gestures that continually go out of camera range quickly become annoying.
• Remember, too, that there's nothing that kills credibility faster than letting your voice rise of the end of a sentence — as if asking a question. When making a declarative statement, be sure to use the authoritative arc in which your voice starts at one note, rises in pitch through the sentence, and drops back down at the end.
Send both sets of leadership presence signals
Leadership presence is represented by two sets of nonverbal signals: One set of signals conveys status, authority, and power. These are the powerful signals many of the leaders I coach display naturally.
But the first thing people look for (especially now, when empathy has never been more important) is a collection of “pro-social” signals that show your warmth, empathy, and inclusiveness. In a team meeting, for example, attendees will be looking to be reassured that you understand and care about them, that you value their input, and that you have their best interests at heart.
To signal both confidence and warmth, send a combination of signals:
• You appear at your empathetic and inclusive best when you stay relaxed, keeping your movements small, slow, and within the computer screen. If you gesture with open palms, you’ll send the ultimate “see, I have nothing to hide” signal. When you keep your elbows in line with your shoulders to make smaller gestures, you also appear self-assured and collected.
• Especially in times of uncertainty, it’s a leadership necessity to show genuine interest by giving whomever is speaking your full attention. When we are face-to-face, eye contact makes that connection; to make virtual eye contact, remember to look at the camera as much as possible. You can also show engagement by leaning slightly forward as someone speaks, nodding in agreement or tilting your head in the universal signal of “giving someone your ear.”
• Because so many of the nonverbal cues we use to assess a speaker are unavailable in a virtual environment (the main reason for “Zoom fatigue”), your audience’s brains have to work harder to understand the full meaning of your remarks. You’ll connect with people even more positively if you wait a few seconds between phrases to let them absorb and analyze what you’ve just said.
• The best tip for looking confident in a virtual meeting is to sit with good posture - facing the screen with shoulders squared, head straight, and feet flat on the ground. In fact, someone viewing you for the first time will make judgments about your leadership presence based more on your posture than on your actual role or title. A side benefit is that good posture tends to make you feel more self-assured.
In person or online, you are communicating over two channels: verbal and nonverbal. While you’re speaking, your audience is simultaneously assessing your tone of voice, facial expressions, hand gestures, and posture for clues about your credibility, warmth, power, and sincerity. Body language savvy can be your key to strengthening business relationships, presenting your ideas with more impact, and projecting leadership presence on Zoom.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vulnerable Leadership Inspired This Team To Pull Together And Save The Company</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Most mornings, Rob Dubé makes a cup of coffee and settles in near a window in his apartment that overlooks Campus Martius Park in downtown Detroit. An urban core of the city, Rob loves to observe the energy of thousands of people streaming through and going about their daily lives. On a gray morning in early March, Rob looked down at the familiar landscape of high-rise buildings and was met with a surreal emptiness: almost no one was out there.
Rob and his business partner Joel Pearlman are Co-CEOs of imageOne, a managed print services company based in metro Detroit. The day before, they received word that one of their larger clients would be testing out working from home for the rest of the week. It was March 12th, and the pandemic was just starting to enter mainstream consciousness in Detroit.
“I picked up the phone and called Joel,” says Rob. “I told him what I was seeing — downtown Detroit is nearly empty. This is real, and if other companies follow suit, this is going to hit us hard. Let’s get ahead of this.” 
Keeping the Team Together
That Friday, imageOne’s executive team gathered for a weekend of intensive planning. Rob and Joel, along with their controller Emily Kmita and president Josh Britton, put themselves to task modeling out the worst-case scenario and financial impact. Pretty quickly, they identified the two priorities that would serve as a litmus test for all of the decisions that lie ahead: they wanted to remain a financially healthy company, and they wanted to protect the financial and mental well-being of their team members. They knew each of those goals couldn’t happen without the other. 
“People often wonder if culture really pays off,” says Rob. “This is when we find out if our culture is what we think it is. This is where all of the hard work we’ve put into building our culture shows up. We’ll find out if it’s for real.”
imageOne has team members in eleven different states, and as stay-at-home orders went into place around the country, the impact on its business was swift and significant. A large portion of the company’s recurring revenue relies on people being in the office printing pages, and they watched those numbers decline in real time. New business was put on hold, service calls declined — worst case scenario, they predicted a 70 percent drop in revenue.
“Based on our projections, we knew we needed to make deep cuts to payroll,” says imageOne President Josh Britton. “Making cuts to expenses and travel was easy — the painful part was jobs. Rather than resort to lay-offs, we wanted to share the pain with the objective of keeping everyone together. We decided to put it to the team to share ideas on how we could get through this in one piece.”
Financial Transparency
After briefing the management team, they made plans for an all-hands video conference meeting on Friday morning to share information with the team and bring them into the planning process. They came up with a simple math problem that projected the reduction of revenue in the worst-case scenario. Josh would lay out the situation and ask for the team’s help in finding additional cuts and deciding how to reduce payroll. Starting the next week, each department would meet to come up with alternative ideas for protecting the financial health of the organization.
“Practicing open-book management gave us a head start,” says Rob. “They know the numbers, they know what an income statement is and they understand the importance of cash. Financial transparency really shows up in times like these — there’s no getting people up to speed, they just get it.”
But financial transparency doesn’t make delivering bad news any easier. Friday morning rolled around, and Josh delivered a clear yet vulnerable message to the team: we need to make payroll reductions and we need your ideas on how we can do that. Walking through their projections, they explained the guiding priorities they’d come up with, and showed what it would look like with full compensation and with reductions. In any scenario, Rob and Joel agreed to forgo their pay during this time.
“It was the hardest meeting I’ve ever led,” says Josh. “You’re looking at 62 faces on your screen, and it’s going to impact every single one of them. There were a lot of tears, and there was a lot of shock. But I was most overwhelmed by feeling the energy of the call shift in real time. People immediately fell in love with the idea of keeping this team together.”
One by one, people started chiming in to encourage one another and express gratitude. One person spoke up and said, “We’re a family, let’s stick together.” Another team member gave a 5-minute long, impromptu motivational speech. Of course nobody liked the new reality — pretty much everybody spent the afternoon away from their work, adjusting their family’s budgets and calling creditors, but the energy was positive and united. 
“After the call, I broke down,” says Rob. “I’ve never been in a position to make a decision that so widely impacted everyone’s financial situation. It felt surreal, I didn’t know what to do next. It was a difficult moment but also uplifting, because there was so much beauty in how it unfolded.”
Let the Answers Come from Within
For the next few days, team members went to work generating new ideas. As each team met, they were guided by the two priorities originally defined by the leadership team: to protect the financial health of the company and the financial and mental well-being of its team members. By the end of the week, they had nearly one hundred cost-cutting and revenue-generating ideas. Ultimately, the team landed in the same place as the leadership team: they would all take a deep payroll cut. Not only that, but team members started stepping up behind the scenes to take additional concessions.
“The true test of one's character is what they do when no one's watching,” says Josh. “Team members started calling me offline and offering to be at the back of the line when we start returning to full compensation. They thought others might be struggling more, and they wanted to keep the company together and healthy. Not for merit or accolades – just because they care.”
With some team members having more time on their hands, they’re taking the opportunity to get creative and dream up new possibilities for the future. People from across the company have formed an ideation committee for six weeks of facilitated creative thinking. At the end, everyone will take their best idea and pitch it to the company in a Shark Tank style presentation.
“In a way, we’ve been given a gift. We’re using this time wisely,” says Rob. “Most of our competitors have laid off at least a third of their staff, and eventually, they're going to have to retool and get people back in and get organized. We know that we’re stronger together, and we’re proving that we can get through anything.”
Make Tough Decisions Early
Every day is a new day in this crisis, and imageOne’s worst-case scenario projections have yet to come to fruition. So far, the decline in revenue hasn’t been as bad as predicted, so team members haven’t taken the full paycheck reduction they planned for. imageOne also secured a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan, and the team will be back to full compensation by the time the next paycheck hits their bank accounts. With things changing so quickly, the key is staying close and keeping everyone well-informed.
“Information is top priority,” says Josh. “Without it, negative talk gets going and people can make assumptions and it causes panic. We meet regularly and we’re open, honest, and transparent. Information automatically lowers the temperature for everyone.”
Genuine Care for the Team
On paper, the events of the last month would be catastrophic for a small business like imageOne. But all the work they’ve done to define their purpose provides a strong foundation for navigating this new terrain. To ensure they are genuinely caring for team members through this time, they started surveying everyone three times a week: do you feel cared for, connected, and informed? It’s now a company metric included in their scorecard, and the goal is to have 90 percent of team members reporting positively.
Even with social distancing, the team is staying close and keeping tabs on each other’s overall health and wellness. imageOne uses a method called the Simple Six to meaningfully check in with team members and the most important aspects of their well-being: mindfulness, sleep, nutrition, movement, connection, and gratitude. It’s a practical list that tends to uncover underlying issues pretty quickly, and gives leadership an opportunity to provide support. In the battle of crisis versus culture, culture is winning at imageOne. 
“This is a reshuffling of the deck that really caters to people who are purpose-driven,” says Josh. “I have a deep sense of hope and faith in this moment, and that comes from every single person in this company. That’s the only place I need to look to believe in what we’re doing, why and who we’re doing it for.”
In the Small Giants Community and beyond, purpose-driven leaders are stepping up to do what’s right when it matters most. Read their stories here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boost Your Creativity And Imagination With These Apps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A decade ago, about 60 percent of CEOs surveyed by IBM, stated that creativity is the most important skill to have in the workplace. With COVID-19 shutdowns, and working by video calls, it seems to be even more critical that leaders and workers have a range of imagination and creative capabilities. 
Here are three creativity-oriented apps that caught my attention:
Audiojack offers a unique concept in terms of boosting creativity and imagination. They provide what the founder, David Tobin, says is an “audio-based movie.” Instead of having all the visual imagery, Audiojack provides only sounds and it allows your mind to fill in the blanks. 
I listened to several Audiojack “movies” and each one had a myriad of sounds, layered together, in ways that indeed had me piecing together my own story of what was taking place. There is no right or wrong answer, the actual storyline is never revealed, you decide what the story narrative is in your own mind. The app is used in education as well as in healthcare. There are a number of experiences on the free plan and then it is $15 per year. Check it out on iOS or Android. 
Brainsparker is another creativity-oriented app and tool. Right now, thanks to COVID-19, they have a free “kids pack” with 100-plus creative activities, an instruction set for how to “spice up your zoom sessions,” and what they call the “gulp! pack” to help you overcome your fears. 
Basically, the Brainsparker iOS app or a daily email they send for Android users or an online picker (see link in previous paragraph), gives you a random visual or text prompt, such as a quote or a question or perhaps a trigger word that creates a response — a card that prompts you to pause and ponder. Companies and individuals have reviewed it well and appreciate the dose of new ideas.
Blek is a puzzle-like game that many users have said is about boosting your imagination. A combination of art and puzzle, according to others. The objective is simple, however, it gets harder and harder to do as the obstacles get more complex — create a line that collects colored circles and avoids the black holes.
I did not download the game, but watched several videos about the puzzle game - I can see why people call it a work of art and a joy to watch. As you set that little line in motion, it sets about moving in a way you hope works to solve each challenge. If it does not, it definitely forces you to think in new ways to do it on your next try. It is available on iOS for $3.99 and on Android for 99 cents.
I do not think much has changed from 2010 when the IBM survey found executives claiming that creativity is the essential skill needed in the workplace. We need that creativity and imagination more than ever - to keep our kids engaged with online school, to do just one more Zoom meeting, and to, really, keep our sanity and wits about us.
Given our current stay-at-home, work-from-home (WFH) orders, what are you doing to keep your creative mind sharp?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Agile Isn’t New: What’s New Is The C-Suite Embracing It</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the global coronavirus crisis is forcing many organizations to act with unaccustomed speed, organizational agility has suddenly become a necessity. The crisis is also making obvious that institutional agility means much more than having lots of agile teams scattered around the organization.
“To create a truly agile enterprise,” as the article, “The Agile C-Suite”, by Bain consultants Darrell K. Rigby, Sarah Elk, and Steve Berez in the May-June 2020 issue of Harvard Business Review (HBR) points out, “the top officers—most, if not all, of the C-suite—must embrace agile principles too.” Agility of course isn’t new. What’s new is to see the C-suite embracing it.
The contrast in stock market performance between firms that have been embracing Agile principles at the senior level for a number of years—-such as Microsoft and Amazon—and two firms that have spurned Agile principles at the senior level—such as GE and IBM—is dramatic.
The Case Of Amazon
Ever since Amazon’s creation in 1994, Jeff Bezos has stressed customer value, as the primary goal of Amazon. Long-term shareholder value, said Bezos in his founding letter to shareholders in 1997 “will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.” At Amazon, shareholder value is the result, not the operational goal. At Amazon the customer comes first, ahead of “short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.”
As detailed here, Bezos has combined customer-value with a focus on the road map for the future; the continuous creation of new businesses; the creation of multiple paths to yes for small bets, while acting as ‘chief slowdown officer’ for big bets. The result is a trillion-dollar company that, just last week, announced plans to spend all of its second quarter profit—some four billion dollars—on its response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including testing and protection for workers, strengthening delivery networks, and boosting wages, rather than return this money to shareholders.
The Cases Of Microsoft And IBM
The transition from big bureaucracy to business agility on a continuing basis is a long-term undertaking involving many steps. At Microsoft, the journey began with one team, then three teams, then 25 teams, then many teams, and then after about 5 years, the new CEO embraced it, and it spread across the entire firm and steadily became part of the culture.
By contrast, IBM’s CEO Ginni Rometty told CNBC in October 2014, “At the end of the day, this is about returning value to shareholders.” IBM’s strategy of returning value to shareholders was built on a foundation of declining revenues, capability-crippling offshoring, fading technical competence, sagging staff morale, debt-financed share buybacks, non-standard accounting practices, tax-reduction gadgets, a debt-equity ratio of around 174 percent, a broken business model and a flawed forward strategy. Business agility didn’t enter the picture. The outcome is now clear. For almost 20 years, IBM has had the most explicit long-term commitment to maximizing shareholder value as reflected in the stock price, yet it has the distinction of destroying more shareholder value than any other company in the Dow Jones Industrial Index.
What An Agile C-Suite Does
Institutional agility means more than having Agile teams. Agility begins at the top, is inspired by the top, and is embodied in how the top conducts itself.
The starting point of agility is the passionate, and even obsessional, pursuit of a crystal-clear mission of the organization. In the case of the private sector, this is value for customers—the Law of the Customer. In order for this obsession to be shared throughout the organization, the C-suite must embrace and communicate it passionately and with all their heart. The commitment to the customer is not just words: it is about providing a clear line of sight to the ultimate customers to those doing the work so that they can take steps and make decisions that will contribute to the goal. Customer focus is not a one-time initiative: it must become a way of life.
The Agile organization sets aside any assumption that the way things have been are the way things are going to be. There is no split between exploitation and exploration: everything the organization does is a potential source of improvement. This means unleashing the creativity of the staff by breaking the work into small pieces that can be handled by small self-organizing teams, working in short cycles with direct feedback from customers—the Law of the Small Team.
It is the C-suite leadership responsibility to establish and maintain a hierarchy of competence rather than a bureaucratic hierarchy of authority where decisions depend solely on where you are in the chain of command and power trickles downwards. It is the C-suite’s responsibility to ensure that information flows horizontally to wherever it is needed, not just vertically, and to create an atmosphere of transparency where problems are aired and discussed openly—the Law of the Network.
The three Laws of Agile define  operational agility (making the existing business better) and create the basis for strategic agility (generating new products and services and so bringing in new customers).
Agile Isn’t New
In one sense, the ideas behind business agility aren’t new. The precursors of Agile management in the 1960s and 1970s, are described in Art Kleiner’s book, The Age of Heretics (Jossey-Bass, 1996). They included self-managing teams and more participatory decision structures .But these practices didn’t succeed in taking over the whole organization, despite huge gains in productivity and engagement achieved on a small scale They were crushed by the entrenched bureaucracy and power structures.
What is new is that we now have CEOs, as at Amazon and Microsoft, who are championing the cause of business agility for the whole organization. For most big organizations, implementing these principles means deep change from the ponderous bureaucracies that dominated the 20th Century economy. It is only with the championship of the C-suite that these ideas can prosper and endure.
In effect, the whole organization has to be reinvented. This means that most strategy, planning and budgeting, auditing, and human resource processes have to be rethought. Metrics have to be reformulated to reflect the clarified organizational mission and its performance.
Agile As A Mindset
One of the most difficult things for the C-suite to grasp about agility is that it involves a different way of thinking as much as a different way of doing. The Agile mindset as something akin to the mindset of a profession, such as that of a lawyer, a doctor or an economist. Agile managers think about problems in characteristic ways. They notice certain kinds of information, data, and concerns in their respective subjects. They analyze the issues in their respective ways. They pursue their respective kinds of solutions.
These different ways of thinking, perceiving and acting in turn generate characteristic attitudes, values, modes of thought and approaches to problems. Such mindsets are not things that can be acquired overnight or in a two-day training course. In effect, the Agile mindset reflects the emergence of a fundamentally different kind of management.
The Agile C-Suite In HBR’s Article
The current HBR article presents an account of the responsibilities of the C-suite of an unnamed major consumer-goods company in its journey towards business agility with a CEO who has the pseudonym ‘Brian Johnson.’ The article contains many Agile insights:
·       Agile principles: “To create a truly agile enterprise, C-suite must embrace agile principles.”
·       Leadership humility: “Agile, in short, requires humility from leaders. We don’t mean a false humility but rather the sort that accelerates learning and bolsters the confidence of every team member.”
·       Managers become coaches: “Agile enables top executives to delegate many of their activities to subordinates so that they can focus on what only they can do.” “the CIO took on the role of coach for the agile leadership team. He pointed out when team members were following agile principles and practices and when they were slipping into dangerous shortcuts or dead ends.”
·       Daily standups: ‘Brian Johnson’ has organized a sequence of four 15-minute daily standups from 8.30am to 9.30am, going from single teams, through various “teams of teams”. “This approach is working so well that Johnson is now experimenting with the process in more parts of the organization, including business units and functional departments.”
·       From meetings to work sessions. Once C-suite gets comfortable with agile principles and practices, they grew increasingly frustrated with old-style management meetings and replace them with problem-oriented work sessions.
·       Continuous improvement: “Senior executives learn to manage the transition as an agile team. They view it as a continuous improvement program, not as a project with predictable end points or fixed completion dates.”
·       Getting out of silos: “The agile process forces leaders to get out of their silos and work together as a multidisciplinary group, breaking through impediments and pivoting when necessary.”
·       Taking the time to get it right: “It took about five months, he told us, for the executive committee to begin thinking and acting as an agile leadership team.”
·       Getting the best staff: “The leadership team decided to dedicate some of the company’s best, most admired managers to the effort and to design the work by starting with the customer.”
·       Agile budgeting: The CFO “commissioned agile teams to develop planning and budgeting processes similar to those used by venture capital firms with start-ups. Previously done annually, the processes would now occur more frequently—at least quarterly—but would be less onerous.”
·       Putting Agile metrics in place: “Rather than relying strictly on financial forecasts, teams would increase the transparency of key assumptions, create ways to test them, and identify potential impediments.”
·       Agile HR: “Now that agile teams were using fully dedicated people rather than part-time allocations, the CHRO needed to develop new career paths and appropriate reward systems for members of the major agile initiative, along with processes for backfilling their previous positions.”
·       Continuous improvement, not one-off: Senior executives learn to manage the transition as an agile team. They view it as a continuous improvement program, not as a project with predictable end points or fixed completion dates.
·       Uniqueness: the article notes that every company and every activity within each company will differ.
Remaining Issues
As the article is discussing an unnamed corporation, it is impossible to verify the story. There are a number of issues on which the reader would like to know more.
·       In the article, the role of the customer is somewhat unclear. The word “customer” is used 19 times, but is this firm truly obsessed with the delivering value to customers?
·       Is Agile something for the whole organization? The firm appears to limit Agile to “innovation” and sets limits on where innovation is inappropriate such as " food or drug safety, anti-discrimination and harassment policies, accounting standards, and quality control." Why not?
·       The CEO ‘Brian Johnson’ as pesented in the aritlce is not exactly passionate about agility. In the article, the CEO is presented as an “arbitrator” or  “balancer” between efficiency and innovation. Is he truly playing a role of Agile champion?
·       The article states that agility in this firm is not an initiative. Yet does the centrality of the Fusion Project for this CEO risk creating the impression that in this firm, agility is simply an initiative, not a way of life?
It is important that Harvard Business Review is highlighting the role of the C-suite in business agility. Wall Street has already got the message.  Although the U.S. economy shrank at a 4.8% annual rate in the first quarter and suffered from 30 million unemployment claims, the stock market finished its best month in years. Why? The answer to the paradox is simple. After a devastating collapse the previous month, investors poured into the “chosen few.” Firms that have demonstrated business agility by taking advantage of technological possibility—Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft—have become the largest and fastest growing organizations in the world, while many others struggle.

    <h5 class="mb-1">These 15 used cars saw the steepest drops in sales when the coronavirus pandemic hit, according to the data</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Car search engine and automotive research firm iSeeCars.com has listed 15 used cars with the largest decrease in sales between Februrary and March as the coronavirus pandemic spread across the US.
Most of the vehicles on the list fall under two categories: "alternative fuel vehicles" or SUVS, not including one minivan and two compact cars.
This includes the Tesla Model 3, which tops the list with a decrease in sales to the tune of 24.2%. In Februrary, 71.5% of used Model 3s were sold within the first 30 days of being listed. By March, this number dropped to 47.4%.
"Overall car sales have plummeted as a result of stay-at-home orders and the economic downturn," iSeeCars CEO Phong Ly said. "But for those fortunate enough to be able to make a car purchase, now is an opportune time as dealers increasingly need to move inventory, and these slow-selling models could present great deals."
iSeeCars tracked over 1.8 million used cars that were listed between February 1 and March 18 to compile the data for the study. The percentage of every car model sold by or before the 30-day mark of being listed was then calculated. However, vehicles discontinued before 2020, heavy-duty vehicles, and "low-volume" cars were not included in the study.
Keep scrolling to see the 15 vehicles on the list:
In February, 57.8% of used CR-Vs were sold within 30 days of being listed. However, this dropped to 42.1% by March.
February saw used Odyssey sales to the tune of 63.4% of the inventory within 30 days of being listed, although this dropped to 47.6% in March.
The third used Honda on the list saw 65.1% of its cars sold within 30 days of being listed. This dropped 15.9% to only 49.1% of sales by 30 days in March.
About 64.1% of used Highlanders were sold in February within 30 days of being listed, which then dropped to 47.9% in the next month.
About 59.7% of the used Honda Pilots were sold within 30 days of being listed in February. This dropped to 43.4% in March.
February saw 53% of its used Honda HR-Vs sold within 30 days of being listed. March, however, only saw 36.4%.
In February, 58.4% of used GX 460s — the only Lexus on the list — were sold within the first 30 days of being listed. In March, this decreased to 41.7%.  
February and March saw 54% and 37.2%, respectively, of used C-HRs sold within 30 days of being listed.
In February, 60% of listed and used RAV4s were sold within 30 days. This dropped 16.8% to 43.2% by the next month.
Used Chevy Spark's sales — before hitting the 30-day listing mark – dropped 17.1% between February and March. It started at 62.6% in February, and ended with 45.4% in March.
"With a low starting price and a long list of standard features, the Chevrolet Spark is a good value for those looking for a small car," Ly said. "Consumers looking for a used version can likely get a great deal on the already affordable vehicle."
About 57.9% of used Model X's were sold within 30 days of being listed in February. This, of course, dropped to 40.4% by next month.
Ly notes that the Model X is the priciest vehicle on the list, averaging at around $70,162 for the "three-year-old versions." However, this decrease in sales could be because the less expensive Model Y — which starts at $52,990 — started deliveries in March.
In February, 53.9% of used Eclipse Cross' were sold within 30 days of being listed. This then dropped 19% to just 34.9% by March.
Ly calls the Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross one of the most inexpensive compact SUVs.
Used Volkswagen Atlas' saw a 19.4% drop in sales: 64.7% were sold within 30 days of being listed in February, while about 45.3% were sold in March.
Ly described the Atlas as "among the best SUVs for families thanks to its cargo space and safety ratings."
About 62.2% of used RAV4 Hybrids were sold within 30 days of listing in February, although this dropped to 41.3% in March.
"The Toyota RAV4 Hybrid saw supply shortages in 2019 due to its popularity," Ly said.
The used Model 3 took the biggest hit during the coronavirus pandemic. Sales dropped 24.2% from February's 71.5% within 30 days of being listed to March's 47.4%.
"The Tesla Model 3 is typically in very high demand, and as a result, it is the used car with the best resale value," Ly said. "However, because they are lingering on lots now is the time when dealers may offer more deals than usual."

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA engineers explain what it's like to drive a nuclear-powered Mars rover from home during the pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Remote work doesn't get much more remote than piloting a robot 140 million miles away on the surface of Mars.
NASA, alongside many other workplaces, has had to shut its doors during the coronavirus pandemic. For engineers and scientists working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) responsible for driving the Curiosity Mars rover, this meant setting up systems so they could continue to communicate with the rover while all stuck in their homes.
Business Insider spoke to two NASA employees currently on the rover team about how they are managing to execute commands and even make scientific advances while working from home.
Alicia Allbaugh has worked on and off at NASA since 1991, and oversees the 75-person rover program which she has worked on since 2006. When she heard rumblings about the pandemic and potential lockdowns on NPR, she started to form a plan for if the rover team suddenly had to ship out. The rover team has had to think about some work-from-home plans in the past in case of earthquakes, Allbaugh said.
Luckily for the rover team, there was already some infrastructure in place because it works with scientists all over the world, so a degree of teleconferencing functionality was already on hand. They were able to do an experimental test run on March 12, five days before NASA shut its offices.
It took everyone a few hours to acclimatize to setting up all their windows and chats so they fit onto home monitor screens. "We figured it out within like two, three hours. We were sort of getting into the groove and understanding the ebb and flow and the pace," she said. The test went off surprisingly well, with the rover receiving and successfully executing a set of orders.
Before NASA issued the order sending its employees home on March 17, Allbaugh had also gone into the office and done an inventory of all the spare monitors and headsets the team had on hand and what they would have to order in. When news did come that employees shouldn't come back to work the next day, her team grabbed what they needed and headed home.
The Curiosity rover is equipped with 3D cameras, which it uses to send 3D images back to its drivers to help work out where it should go next. Ordinarily the team look at these images with special high-tech 3D goggles which flip which eye is looking at the image at a rate of about 60 times per second.
"The reason we have them, in general, is because the Rover drivers need to visualize how the Rover moves over 3D train," said Matt Gildner, the rover planner team lead.
Gildner oversees a team of about 20 planners who write and send commands telling the rover where to go. He added that the 3D images give the drivers a better idea of how steep a slope might be, or how sandy the ground might be.
But the goggles require heavy-duty graphics cards normally used in gaming computers, and it wasn't going to be practical to get these working at home, so NASA found a less high-tech solution.
Rover planners are now using simple plastic red-blue glasses, the same kind you would use to watch a 3D movie. Gildner says he pops the glasses on for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time about three times a day to look around at where the rover is.
"It really helps us do our jobs. I mean, we couldn't do it without it," he said.
The various groups that work on Curiosity are used to being in large rooms where they can easily talk to each other and convene amongst themselves, and simulating this kind of communication was a big challenge for the team.
Broadly speaking the work is split into uplink (what information NASA is sending the rover) and downlink (what information the rover is sending to NASA).
"The downlink area where they look at the data is similar to what you've seen in like 'Apollo 13' [...] with little signs above everyone, and they're looking at information from various systems on the vehicle," Allbaugh said.
Uplink takes place on a different floor. "[Uplink is] mostly in one really large room that has a whole bunch of computers around the edge of it, and a very large table in the center with people on laptops usually as well," Allbaugh added.
As a planner, Gildner works on the uplink side of the team and said it was a struggle to mimic this flow of communication. "We are used to being able to have everyone in one room and have some conversations that are within smaller groups in one room, and then some conversations that participate with everyone," he said.
His solution: double headsets.
"What we've done is actually we set up multiple teleconferences all at once. I will have one headset called into my team of  rover drivers and we'll be chatting, and I'll have that in one ear. And then I will be called into the larger teams group and have that in my second ear. And so I'm like muting myself in between two teleconferences at once and chatting back and forth and doing this for like eight hours a day," he said.
"It does make you a bit more worn out, you have to concentrate a bit more. But it's actually worked very well ... we're able to kind of mimic what we would be doing if we were all in one place in one conference room, or one operations room, trying to work with different teams," he added.
Wearing his 3D glasses as well as his two headsets is what Gildner calls his "super nerd" look. "You've got to do both headsets at once too, because that's really key to the whole look," he said.
On March 20 a set of commands that were sent to Curiosity were successfully executed, and the robot drilled a rock sample at a location called "Edinburgh," and is now headed on to yet another drilling operation looking for rocks to analyze. In total, the robot has rolled 166 metres (545 feet) since its human operators had to set up shop at home.
For Gildner, piloting the rover has taken on a special significance during lockdown. "One of the big draws of working on a spacecraft operation, especially on Mars, is that every day we're driving to a new place and I get to look at images that no human has ever seen before," he said.
"We all get to kind of escape on Mars for a few hours every week," he added, pointing out that Curiosity's photos are also uploaded for the public to see, should anyone else care to escape to Mars.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The first electric flying car races of the 21st century could take place as early as this year, according to Alauda, which developed the Airspeeder electric flying car.
The first Airspeeder prototype debuted in summer 2019, and now the company is at what it calls an advanced stage of testing. Test pilots from the US Air Force were recruited to test earlier versions of the flying car, and it's now ready to begin testing the newest MK4 model that will be used in races, though tests are currently on hold because of coronavirus restrictions. 
Alauda plans for MK4 races to be the next popular motorsport at the intersection of science fiction and gaming, drawing fans of other racing sports and esports. Once races can proceed, the sport will be available to stream globally, and spectators will be limited to a few luxury VIPs.
Take a look at the Airspeeder here.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Ferrari that was used by Rome's police force from 1963 to 1968 is now on sale.
The Ferrari 250 GTE is considered one of the automaker's most popular models, ultimately evolving into three different series throughout four years, according to Girardo & Co. But unlike any other Ferrari build, the 250 GTE that's now on sale with Girardo & Co has a unique history: the Ferrari 250 GTE Polizia was used by Rome's police force during a time when crime-related car chases were at a high.
Before the arrival of the 250 GTE, the police had been driving an Alfa Romeo Giulia 1600. However, the decision to purchase a Ferrari came after one of the force's most revered officers, Armando Spatafora, said, "What could be better than a Ferrari?" in response to being asked what he would need to be "complete," according to Girardo & Co.
This statement then started a series of events that ultimately led to the purchase of the now "legendary" 250 GTE Polizia vehicle.
That exact Ferrari 250 GTE Polizia is now being sold with its robust history file that includes police documentation and Ferrari build sheets. The car dons a body fitted by Pininfarina and a tan leatherette interior that contrasts its black exterior paint.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I've covered Tesla for over a decade and for that entire time, I've constantly insisted that it isn't a Silicon Valley tech company, but rather a carmaker. Just like General Motors, Toyota, Ford, or Mercedes-Benz, just with electric motors instead of internal-combustion engines.
Wrong! So wrong!
But not because Tesla is actually a Silicon Valley tech company. It isn't. Silicon Valley doesn't really create technology companies anymore; instead, it creates companies that sit on top of the internet — mainly the mobile internet these days — and sell attention-spans to advertisers and services to businesses. 
In effect, they're media companies whose content is generated for free by users: Google searches, Facebook posts, and so on. Apple is an exception, but there we have a design firm, effectively, that lives on the exceptional profit margins of its premium devices, chiefly the iPhone.
There have always been powerful media companies and media conglomerates, but nobody ever confused them with old-economy technology companies, such as automakers, aviation giants, or even the first wave of computer companies, such as IBM.
Now that we're something like four decades into the "tech" transformation of the economy, we've forgotten what actual technology companies look like. The best example, from the previous century, is General Electric, which can trace its roots to Thomas Edison and the late 19th century. GE is the quintessential American conglomerate.
But it's importance, while still critical, has been fading. The successor, it dawned on me a few weeks ago, is Tesla.
It should have been obvious to me all along. Here's why:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hidden in San Francisco's Bayview neighborhood is a four-story castle with underground caves that was once home to the Albion Ale & Porter Brewery.
Albion Castle was built in 1870 as a personal residence and brewery, with a natural underground aquifer producing 10,000 gallons of water daily and providing the water needed for ale production.
It's since been a water-bottling company, private residence, a tech support center for the blog Laughing Squid, and has even hosted smaller events like a Google dinner party and a lavish Halloween bash. It now belongs to Bill Gilbert, a former San Francisco police officer and real-estate investor who bought the castle in 2012 for $900,000. 
A tall fence and towering trees surround Albion Castle, making it the perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. "I don't even feel like I'm in San Francisco," Jennifer Gilbert, Bill Gilbert's daughter, told Business Insider. 
Take a look around the hidden fairy-tale home.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NHS coronavirus contact tracing app will ask users for personal details despite concerns about patients' privacy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NHS contact tracing app will ask users for personal details despite concerns about patients’ privacy.
The app has been devised by NHSX, the digital arm of the Health Service. If someone downloads it, Bluetooth technology is likely to track who they come within 6ft of for at least 15 minutes. 
If a user develops symptoms they can inform the NHS, triggering an alert sent to other users they have come into contact with.
However, those who download the app will also be invited to enter the first half of their postcode, and later their gender and age bracket. 
The news comes after more than 175 UK academics signed a letter voicing concerns about the app. 
Dr Natalie Banner, from the group Understanding Patient Data, warned personal details ‘could make people identifiable’.
The NHS stressed that providing the data will be voluntary, adding it will be used only to identify virus hotspots and trends. 
An NHSX spokesman said: ‘Users will remain anonymous up to the point where they volunteer their own details, and there will be no database that allows the de-anonymisation of users.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Space X passes final parachute test ahead its historic launch on May 27 that will mark America's first manned spaceflight in nearly nine years before their 2024 Moon trip</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Space X completed its final parachute test as the aerospace company and Nasa prepare to launch two astronauts to the International Space Station on May 27. 
Space X, founded by Elon Musk, shared news of the successful test run Friday on Twitter as they gear up for the historic lift off of Demo-2, the first crewed test flight  of the Crew Dragon spacecraft. 
'27th and final test of Crew Dragon’s upgraded Mark 3 parachutes complete,' Space X wrote.
'One step closer to flying NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station and safely returning them back home to Earth.'
A photo of the test showed the Crew Dragon's parachutes fully functional as it safely floated to the ground. 
Space enthusiasts are anticipating the launch as it is latest step is helping push the U.S. back to the front of human spaceflight.
It will be America's first manned spaceflight in nearly nine years. 
NASA has been unable to fly astronauts since the Space Shuttle fleet was retired 2011, and have been forced to rely on Russian Soyuz rockets for rides to the International Space Station at $84million a seat.
Space officials also complete an investigation into an engine failure on the first stage of the Space X Falcon 9 rocket during a previous launch in March. 
During that test, 60 of Space X's Starlink internet satellites were aboard, Space.com reports. 
The misstep didn't interfere with the overall mission since the satellites reached orbit, but NASA and Space X conducted an investigation since the upcoming launch would also use a Falcon 9 rockte. 
'We have reviewed the anomaly resolution of the Starlink launch and actually have cleared the engines on our vehicle for that failure,"said  Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. 
Space X has developed Crew Dragon in contact with the Commercial Crew Program. 
 In 2014, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to create a spacecraft capable of flying humans to the space station. 
The following years were bogged down by funding issues and technical problems that halted progress. 
However, Space X's deal includes finishing the capsule and flying six operational crew missions to and from ISS.  
Meanwhile, Boeing has had difficulty with its Starliner spacecraft, including arriving in the wrong orbit during a test flight and problems with deploying parachutes.
It’s unclear when Boeing will need to send another Starliner to the space station without launching astronauts later this year
An investigation team is still looking into why the Starliner's automated timer was off by 11 hours during the December test flight.
NASA's Artemis mission that is set to land the first woman and next man on the moon has just turned into a space race between billionaires.
Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX have been chosen to develop human landing systems for the mission set to launch in 2024.
Along with the two tech tycoons, NASA has also awarded Dynetics part of the 10 month contract that totals $967 million.  
The firms are set to create lander concepts by 2021 and NASA will then pick one or more winners to begin building the spacecraft. 
Bringing humans back to the moon has been a dream of NASA for years, but with the Artemis mission just four years away, the agency is working tirelessly to make sure it becomes a reality.
The US has not had a human landing system since 1972, but the technologies are vital for the American space agency's deep space exploration plans. 
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said during a live feed of the announcement: 'It is important that the agency do this now, our country and in fact the whole world has been shaken by the coronavirus.'
'We need to give people hope and something dream about that will inspire the nation and the entire world.'
'With these contract awards, America is moving forward with the final step needed to land astronauts on the Moon by 2024, including the incredible moment when we will see the first woman set foot on the lunar surface.'
NASA awarded the Blue Origin team with $579 million, the Dynetics team with $253 million and SpaceX with $135 million.
Boeing, in partnership with Aerojet Rocketdyne, also bid on HLS but was not awarded with a study contract. The Boeing proposal included using an upgraded Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which Boeing is currently building for NASA.
Blue Origin, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is developing the Integrated Lander Vehicle (ILV).
This is a three-stage lander that will launch on the firm's own New Glenn Rocket System and ULA Vulcan launch system.
Bezos revealed plans of 'going to the moon' in 2019, when he shared elaborate concept images of self-sustaining space habitats reminiscent of the film Interstellar, with lush greenery and futuristic homes within its walls.
Blue Origin said its lunar lander, dubbed Blue Moon, will be able to carry all sorts of payloads to the surface and can hold 'multiple metric tons.'
The craft will 'enable a sustained human presence on the moon,' the company said. And, according to the CEO, the company already has about six customers.
The lander builds upon technology the firm has been testing over the past few years in its New Shepard rocket, including propulsion and precision guidance, as well as the vertical landing system.
The firm has quietly been developing Blue Moon for years.
SpaceX has also joined the team and is set to design its Starship rocket, which it is currently developing and refining in Texas.
SpaceX said a 'lunar optimized Starship' would bring crew from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface under NASA's Artemis program.
'A lunar optimized Starship can fly many times between the surface of the Moon and lunar orbit without flaps or heat shielding required for Earth return,' the company said.
However, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Bridenstine have a history of bad blood, so it may be a surprise the firm was chosen as for this project.
During a conference in 2019, Bridenstine re-hashed Tweets criticizing SpaceX for failing to meet timelines for the development of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, saying they were meant as a warning to all of the space agency's contractors about setting realistic development schedules.
'I have been focused on returning to realism when it comes to costs and schedules,' said the NASA Administrator.
'So I was signaling - and I haven't done it just to SpaceX but to all of our contractors - that we need more realism built into the development timelines.'
But Musk has been working with NASA to develop the Crew Dragon capsule that will shuttle US astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS).
NASA has also chosen Dynetics to design the human landing system, which will work the Dynetics Human Landing System (DHLS) – a single structure providing the ascent and descent capabilities that will launch on the ULA Vulcan launch system.
The Alabama-based firm has excelled in designing a myriad of useful components for space, including satellites, propulsion systems, vehicles, satellites and more.
NASA's partners will refine their lander concepts during the 10 month contracts.
During that time, the agency will evaluate which of the contractors will perform initial demonstration missions and then choose the final designs to be develop for Artemis.
Lisa Watson-Morgan, HLS program manager at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, said: 'I am confident in NASA's partnership with these companies to help achieve the Artemis mission and develop the human landing system returning us to the Moon.'
'We have a history of proven lunar technical expertise and capabilities at Marshall and across NASA that will pave the way for our efforts to quickly and safely land humans on the Moon in 2024.
Artemis was the twin sister of Apollo and goddess of the Moon in Greek mythology. 
NASA has chosen her to personify its path back to the Moon, which will see astronauts return to the lunar surface by 2024 -  including the first woman and the next man.
Artemis 1, formerly Exploration Mission-1, is the first in a series of increasingly complex missions that will enable human exploration to the Moon and Mars. 
Artemis 1 will be the first integrated flight test of NASA’s deep space exploration system: the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the ground systems at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.  
Artemis 1 will be an uncrewed flight that will provide a foundation for human deep space exploration, and demonstrate our commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond. 
During this flight, the spacecraft will launch on the most powerful rocket in the world and fly farther than any spacecraft built for humans has ever flown.
It will travel 280,000 miles (450,600 km) from Earth, thousands of miles beyond the Moon over the course of about a three-week mission. 
Orion will stay in space longer than any ship for astronauts has done without docking to a space station and return home faster and hotter than ever before. 
With this first exploration mission, NASA is leading the next steps of human exploration into deep space where astronauts will build and begin testing the systems near the Moon needed for lunar surface missions and exploration to other destinations farther from Earth, including Mars. 
The will take crew on a different trajectory and test Orion’s critical systems with humans aboard.
The SLS rocket will from an initial configuration capable of sending more than 26 metric tons to the Moon, to a final configuration that can send at least 45 metric tons. 
Together, Orion, SLS and the ground systems at Kennedy will be able to meet the most challenging crew and cargo mission needs in deep space.
Eventually NASA seeks to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon by 2028 as a result of the Artemis mission.
The space agency hopes this colony will uncover new scientific discoveries, demonstrate new technological advancements and lay the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Foreign arrivals to UK could FINALLY be quarantined and forced to install NHS contact tracing app to reduce risk of letting in a new wave of virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Foreign visitors to the UK could face time in quarantine as the Government 'actively' considers stronger anti-coronavirus measures at the borders, a senior minister revealed today.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that new arrivals could also be forced to download a new contract app onto their smartphone as a condition of entry.
New restrictions would make the UK one of the last countries to introduce them, with the country very much an outlier in recent weeks by not halting inbound flights or insisting arrivals are checked.
People arriving are advised to self-isolate but there is no enforced testing. 
Home Secretary Priti Patel is  believed to be among those who have demanded tougher rules for foreign visitors and the remaining Brits still abroad who make it home.
Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show Mr Shapps said: 'I think it is important that as we are seeing the numbers decrease and the R rate we hope decrease... that we do ensure that the sacrifices in a sense - social distancing - that we are asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country.
'I am actively looking at these issues right now so that when we have infection rates within the country under control we are not importing.'
Although the vast majority of global air travel has collapsed, flights are still arriving, and ports are also allowing mostly freight traffic into the UK to keep vital services and firms going.
The boss of Heathrow is among those who has urged ministers to introduce mass screening at airports. In a major intervention, chief executive John Holland-Kaye  wrote to Health Secretary Matt Hancock to demand stringent regulations to combat coronavirus.
Last week Bournemouth Airport became the first UK airport to start checking passengers for signs of coronavirus.
Bosses have installed ‘thermal fever detection’ cameras that are capable of recording body temperatures and alerting border guards to anyone with a fever.
The tripod-mounted cameras have been fixed to the airport’s staff entrance but will soon be installed at every entrance to the airport’s departures and arrivals terminals.
Speaking to Sky News's Ridge on Sunday this morning, Mr Shapps announced that the new smartphone contact tracing app being developed by the NHS's digital arm would start trials on the Isle of Wight this week.
And he mooted the idea of making its use mandatory for new arrivals - although it is unclear how people who do not possess a mobile phone would be affected.
He said: 'I think it would be wrong ... if we are all still being asked to socially distance, for people coming in not to do the same thing.
'So we'll be looking at things like this app -which very soon, in two or three weeks' time we are going to be asking the whole country to download - which will help with the test and track and trace, this is obviously the tracking part of it, that's very important. 
'We could be asking everybody who comes here to be required to have that app and the same rules apply to anyone visiting which is, as you know, to stay locked down effectively.
'The same social distance rules clearly would need to apply to everybody under those circumstances.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to dress like a grown up with Shane Watson: New Zoom essential? Elegant earrings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There is surely no surprise that we're all browsing fashion websites these days — the surprise is what we're looking for.
If I want to buy clothes, I go straight to the place I know I'll find them: a button-through summer dress (zara.com), a good pair of khaki trousers (irisfashion.co.uk), but when I'm lockdown browsing, I'm more interested in the dreamy catalogue images: the pretty tiled floors, the flowers on the table, the cracked leather armchair, the scarf around the model's hair and always, more than anything, the earrings.
They're not always credited, sadly, because when the stylists put these images together, the earrings were just a detail to set off the little black dress or the little white swimsuit —they weren't to know the earrings would become the main event. We won't be needing a black dress any time soon, let alone a swimsuit, but earrings are newly appealing. 
When a change of top, a slick of lipstick, plus ear jewellery is our new three-step (Zoom) party preparation, earrings have roughly 65 per cent more going for them than they did before coronavirus.
The other irresistible thing about earrings in May 2020 is you don't have to try them on. Lockdown bullseye.
There are no rules when it comes to great earrings: one woman's glamorous candelabra is another's gaudy Christmas bauble. You need to go with what suits you, including your height and the length of your neck. If you're short, you don't want a giant earring swinging around at chin level.
Add a drop or a charm to a small hoop.
Gold and misshapen pearls work well together.
Mismatched or single earrings are newly smart.
Pick earrings bold enough to show on camera.
Striking the right balance between eye catching and distracting is all important; what looked fabulous on the Stella McCartney catwalk (earrings so big they grazed the shoulders) may well look comical in real life, and beware 'statement' earrings. Generally anything prefixed with the word statement is something you'll wear once and tire of.
If you want earrings with impact, that flatter your face, then pretty materials — the glow of gold or the brightness of turquoise — deliver the best bang for your buck.
As for what's in fashion right now, it ranges from tassel fans to anything featuring a charm or droplet. Hoops are still going strong, and now they're often embellished — see Whistles' pearl hoops (£21.75, whistles.com); Simone Rocha's beaded hoops (£195, matches fashion.com) or Anna + Nina's rainbow enamelled hoops (£100, anthropologie.com).
Another trend that's not going anywhere is mismatched earrings, which look chic providing the earrings have some common ground. If in doubt, asymmetric charms on small hoops is the safe way to go and you can find plenty of quirky combinations at jewellery brand Timeless Pearly (£250, matchesfashion.com).
Alternatively, Anna + Nina (sold at trouva.com) do charming individual earrings to pair up with a plain stud or hoop; these work particularly well if you have more than one piercing per ear and can wear several at once. Take your pick from the single turquoise stud, to daisies, pearls in a peapod and evil eyes.
The beauty of these charms is if you decide they don't work as earrings for you, they'll work as a gift — on a chain or sleeper earring — come Christmas.
This isn't a time for fine jewellery; it's a moment for mixing it up and having fun.
One of the best brands for gold and pearl earrings is Alighieri. The designs have the raw beauty and simplicity of late medieval heirlooms, at a fraction of the cost.
The infernal storm earrings (£350, alighieri.co.uk) with their chunky baroque drop pearls are my favourites.
Another reliable, more affordable brand is Arlette Gold, where you can get coin hoop earrings (£43, arlettegold.com) or turquoise studded huggies — the fat hoops you wear tight to your ear (£32).
But if you want to go for the best, that would be the queen of semi-precious jewellery, Pippa Small; her gold vermeil turquoise studs from her less pricey Turquoise Mountain range are top of my wish list (£80, pippasmall.com).
J.Crew does excellent quality earrings. Two stand-out pairs at the moment are its dangly white beaded ones (£44, jcrew.com) — white is a surprisingly effective colour for earrings at this time of year — or the raffia fan earrings (£73).
Otherwise, Accessorize is always worth a look, and its pearl hoop set is a steal at just £4 (uk.accessorize.com).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fears Mount About Inflation Returning With a Vengeance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sign up here for our daily coronavirus newsletter on what you need to know, and subscribe to our Covid-19 podcast for the latest news and analysis.
Even a calamity of disease, death and economic destruction afflicting the world all at once isn’t enough to suppress the notion in some quarters that inflation could return with a vengeance.
The coronavirus crisis has killed hundreds of thousands, incapacitated millions and affected the livelihoods of billions -- prompting policy makers to fear a deflation spiral reminiscent of the Great Depression. But economists including former Bank of England official Charles Goodhart, and investors such as BNP Paribas Asset Management, are asking if a different phenomenon lurks in the wreckage of global growth.
Such contrarians wonder if an environment of ultra-loose monetary and fiscal easing, commodity shortages, frayed supply chains and braking globalization might be fertile ground for surging consumer prices. Reinforcing that shift, monetary authorities could face pressure to keep interest rates low, capping the cost of servicing ballooned government debt while allowing inflation to erode it too.
Even some traditionally deflation-wary thinkers have begun pondering that outcome. Former International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard recently wrote that high inflation is “unlikely but not impossible,” a sentiment echoed by former European Central Bank policy maker Peter Praet.
“I wouldn’t say that it’s a given that we’re going to be in a longer-term inflationary environment,” said Karen Ward, chief market strategist EMEA at JPMorgan Asset Management. “But I wouldn’t say it’s going to be a negligible probability either.”
A limited dose of inflation might be welcome to central bankers who have spent trillions of dollars over the years in stimulus to achieve that. But such a prospect is far from their minds at present as they try to help economies facing eye-watering increases in unemployment. Almost half of the world’s workforce is in danger of losing livelihoods from the crisis, according to the International Labour Organisation.
“The deflationary shock is dominating, that’s absolutely clear,” Praet said in an interview. “There’s a collapse of demand.”
Markets reflect that view, in tune with the oil slump and the prevailing perspective of weak prices sapped by adverse demographics, new technologies and globalization. Inflation expectations, as proxied by five-year, five-year forward swap rates, are near record lows in the U.S. and Europe. The U.K. 10-year breakeven rate is down nearly three quarters of a point below last year’s peak.
Some investors see things differently. BNP Paribas Asset Management, which oversees more than $450 billion, has started building an overweight position in commodities for the first time in four years, while going underweight bonds. Ardea Investment Management, a Sydney-based fixed income asset manager, said it “materially” added inflation exposure from late March after the collapse in market expectations of price growth.
“In terms of tail risks not being focused on, inflation is definitely one of them,” said Gopi Karunakaran, a money manager at Ardea.
That narrative diverges from another argument over the years -- for example from Germany’s Bundesbank -- that underlying conditions in some economies have long supported a pickup in prices.
One strand emphasizes the synchronized stimulus -- with monetary easing supercharged by fiscal largess -- as opposed to the asymmetric response during the financial crisis, when central banks cut rates and started quantitative easing, but governments reined in budgets.
“What we are doing is creating a policy framework that has an inflation bias in it, which is the first time we’ve had that in generations,” said Dario Perkins, chief European economist at TS Lombard in London and a former U.K. Treasury official. “The policy response is a war-time policy response.”
That conflict theme is one that Goodhart finds apt. In a March 27 paper with Manoj Pradhan, founder of Talking Heads Macroeconomics, he wrote that commodity costs will rebound with an economic recovery after lockdowns are lifted and stimulus takes effect. Inflation could exceed 5% in 2021, and perhaps even reach 10% -- outcomes resembling the aftermaths of World Wars I and II.
“The monetary and fiscal expansion is aimed at, and will succeed at, putting money in the hands of people,” Goodhart, a BOE rate setter from 1997 until 2000, said in an interview. “There will be some degree of pent-up demand.”
Goods disruptions caused by the virus -- for example with Brazilian farmers unable to harvest coffee beans -- might also linger. Colin Harte, a multi-asset portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management, warns that the supply side “could be more damaged than we realized.”
The further consequences of a potential unwinding of globalization, and a renewed focus on local production, builds on that narrative.
“In the latter stages of the recovery, amid continued de-globalization in goods trade and less elastic global supply, fiscal policies may begin to stoke inflation,” Berenberg Senior Economist Kallum Pickering said.
Some economic data might already point to price pressures. U.S. money supply is surging, and Tim Congdon, a longtime watcher of such data, anticipates it will see its largest increase in peacetime this year -- followed by an “inflationary boom.”
For some analysts however, the prospect of inflation is seriously remote in a world where unemployment is going through the roof.
“It is naive to think everyone is going to get their jobs back when this pandemic virus goes away,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank NA. “Massive job losses mean price declines for many goods are on the way.”
For Goodhart’s thesis of “double-digit” inflation to unfold, Perkins reckons authorities would need to succeed relatively quickly in limiting deaths and shoring up growth, which isn’t a given. He isn’t worried.
Blanchard, in an April 24 article for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, also sees a far greater probability of low inflation. But a combination of swelling public debt, a jump in real interest rates, and deliberately loose monetary policy to aid government financing, could produce a different outcome.
“Inevitably there are risks, the key one being whether the huge policy stimulus under way could ultimately result in inflation either by accident or design,” HSBC Holdings Plc Global Chief Economist Janet Henry wrote in a note on Monday. “If policy makers underestimate the permanent damage to supply from the pandemic and stimulate aggregate demand too much, then inflation would follow.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Telecommunications satellites Express-80 and Express-103 will be launched on 30 July, the Proton-M carrier rocket needed for the launch will be repaired by June, a space industry source said.
In April, three Proton-M heavy-lift launch vehicles designated for launching satellites from the Baikonur Cosmodrome were returned to the Khrunichev Centre in Moscow so that low-quality parts can be replaced, a source in space and rocket industry said.
The defective parts, produced between 2015 and 2016, were discovered in March due to checks under a new quality control system introduced by Roscosmos.
According to the Russian Satellite Communications Company, the Express-103 satellite is designed to provide a package of communications services, such as digital TV, telephony, videoconferencing, data transmission, Internet access, and to deploy satellite networks by applying VSAT technology.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus Australia live updates: Chief medical officer urges more Aussies to download COVIDsafe app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Speaking at a press conference today, Mr Murphy said the more Aussies who download the app released last week, the greater likelihood of restrictions easing soon.
He said an increase in download numbers will give leaders “confidence” to be more “bold” in easing restrictions.
His comments come ahead of a National Cabinet meeting on Friday in which leaders are slated to discuss lockdown restrictions that have been in place for over a month.
RELATED: Why you should download COVIDSafe now
“The more people that download the app, the more confidence the National Cabinet will have about that one aspect of our preparedness that we’re still a little bit anxious about — the capacity to really get on top of contacts as soon as possible,” Mr Murphy said.
“The more confidence they can have, the more bold they might be.”
More than 4.25 million Australians have downloaded the COVIDSafe App since it was launched a week ago.
The app is designed to give state and territory health officials the ability to identify people who might have come into contact with a person who tests positive to coronavirus with ease.
However, the tracing app is still not yet fully operational.
Currently if a person  tests positive to the deadly virus, their information won’t be passed through the mobile phone application because the states and territories are yet to nut out how the system will work.
Speaking to the ABC today, a Department of Health spokesperson said : “The rules on privacy are being finalised, along with final IT testing.”
“The system will be operational next week ahead of the decision on possible easing of restrictions.”
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd admitted to the national broadcaster there had been a delay in the access to data being made available despite the huge number of Aussies signing up.
“This (app) has been implemented very quickly,” he said.
“What we’re doing is making sure that the operations are going to work appropriately and safely, but also (making) sure that the people in the contact-tracing facilities in the states and territories are trained on how to use the app, and how to use it appropriately.”
Professor Kidd said the delay in the access to data didn’t mean Australians should avoid the app.
“The important thing is that if people have downloaded the app and they have it running in the background on their phone, it’s already gathering details of people you’ve been in close contact with.
“There’s a delay from now until when the contact tracer in the state or territory where you are based has activated the system.”
At his press conference today, Mr Murphy said the government’s strategy would be to take “cautious gentle steps” with regards to easing lockdown restrictions, to avoid a second outbreak of the deadly virus.
Easing of restrictions is likely to happen in stages, with weekly re-assessments along the way.

Only NSW, Victoria, and Queensland have recorded new cases of coronavirus today, with Tasmania reporting its third consecutive COVID-free day.
While the state's health minister Sarah Courtney was pleased by the positive results, she urged Tasmanians to remain vigilant to avoid a second wave.
“We know in other jurisdictions, we know in other countries we have seen second waves which have had devastating consequences,” she said.
Ms Courtney said it was important people continued to be tested for COVID-19.

The state’s total remains at 221 cases, with acting director of public health Dr Scott McKeown backing the push for continued testing.
“A concerted effort is being made to identify any further cases of coronavirus in the North West,” Dr McKeown said.
“Anyone who lives in the North-West who currently, or in the last few days, has had respiratory symptoms like a cough, sore throat, runny nose, or fever should arrange testing through the Public Health Hotline on 1800 671 738 or their GP.”

Three people in NSW have been charged for breaking coronavirus lockdown restrictions in the past 24 hours.
These include two teenagers who allegedly trespassed in Edgeworth, a 63-year-old man in Redfern who was allegedly drinking in an alcohol-free zone, and a 37-year-old woman in Dulwich Hill who police say was driving erratically.
According to NSW police, none could provide a reasonable excuse for being outside.

South Australia's chief medical officer Nicola Spurrier has confirmed zero new cases of coronavirus in the state for the 11th consecutive day.
As of today, SA only has seven active cases, with 427 people now recovered from COVID-19.
With the news that once again South Australia had recorded no new cases, Premier Steven Marshall said the government had established a transition committee to look at relaxing restrictions over a period of time.
"When we look to ease the restrictions, we have to be firmly focused on the health risk," Mr Marshall said.
"We only get one shot at this."
Ms Spurrier noted a 98% recovery rate from the virus, and is hopeful the state could soon be free of COVID-19.
"If we don’t have any more cases, soon we will be able to say that we have no one with COVID-19 in the state, which will certainly be something to celebrate."
Mr Marshall also announced playgrounds and skate parks will be re-opened, with social distancing rules applied.

Brendan Murphy today confirmed that advice on schools and school-aged children has not changed.
The chief medical officer reiterated that children are not high transmitters of COVID-19, and there is little risk to children contracting the virus.
"We think that children are not high transmitters of this virus in the school environment. We have always said there is a potential risk for adults, in the staff room, adult interactions at the school, pick ups and drop off," he said.
Following criticism of Victoria&amp;#x27;s decision to keep state schools closed, Mr Murphy said Premier Daniel Andrews' move was based on the state’s desire to stop movement, rather than any concern about the safety of children.
This morning, federal education minister Dan Tehan attacked Victorian Premier Dan Andrews' decision to keep state schools closed.
"This is a failure of leadership from Dan Andrews. And it is the most disadvantaged children who are being most affected," Mr Tehan said.
He accused the premier of “taking a sledgehammer” to education and exposing vulnerable children to disadvantage by encouraging parents to keep their kids home from school.

Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says there are currently 6801 cases in Australia, with an increase of 18 cases in last 24 hours, below the target of 20.
In light of the achievement, Mr Murphy says the government is continuing to look at what measures can be relaxed, but warns against complacency.
"There are still new cases and there are still small outbreaks detected in Victoria and New South Wales, there is still evidence of some low level community transmission.
"That’s why we’ve been saying for some time we cannot be complacent."
He said monitoring of Australians via the tracing app Covidsafe shows there has be an increase in movement in recent days since restrictions were relaxed in some states.
"This virus is still in our community, it’s still with us, we are in a much better position than just about any other country in the world, but we have to be careful as we chart the next couple of months."
He later said the government's strategy would be to take "cautious gentle steps" with regards to easing lockdown restrictions, to avoid a second outbreak of the deadly virus.
Easing of restrictions is likely to happen in stages, with re-assessments along the way.

An 83-year-old woman has been confirmed as the ninth Western Australian person to die from coronavirus, bringing Australia's death toll to 95.
WA Premier Mark McGowan confirmed the death today, revealing the woman contracted Covid-19 from close contact last month.
She was admitted to hospital in mid-April and died on 30 April.
WA recorded no new cases overnight, the fourth consecutive day of zero cases. They now have only 19 active cases across the state.

Western Australia's Premier Mark McGowan has urged his state to continue social distancing, revealing that a Perth man has been arrested for breaching quarantine.
In a passionate plea to Western Australians, he said "don't be an idiot" when it comes to social distancing, adding that a group effort will lead to strict measures potentially being eased in the coming weeks.
Mr McGowan revealed the latest individual caught flouting the rules was known to police, and was arrested while being served a summons relating to a previous breach of quarantine requirements.
The man has been remanded in custody.
"Officers attended the person's address to serve a summons relating to a previous breach of quarantine requirements, officers again found the male has not complied, and was subsequently arrested," Mr McGowan said.
"The person appeared before the first Perth Magistrates Court on Friday, where he was remanded in custody to reappear on the 11th of May."
Mr McGowan later said: " “He’s now in custody because he couldn’t follow the rules. He can enjoy a jail cell rather than his lounge room over this period."
The arrest comes as the state recorded its ninth death.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has confirmed the death of an 83-year-old woman who contracted Covid-19 from close contact.
She was admitted to hospital in mid-April and died on 30 April. This is the ninth COvid-19 death for the state.
WA recorded no new cases overnight, the fourth consecutive day of zero cases. They now have only 19 active cases across the state.
"My message today is we can't afford to get comfortable. Don't be an idiot," he asserted.
"We're all in this together and we must abide by the rules. Keep social distancing and keep up the good personal hygiene.
"The more we do this, the sooner we can get back to normal. We'll continue to review the situation over the coming week in conjunction with the National cabinet process, to work out what further changes we can put in place on Friday of this week."

Hours after he attacked Victorian premier Daniel Andrews' decision to keep state schools closed on ABC Insiders, Education Minister Dan Tehan has withdrawn his comments.
In a statement, Mr Tehan admitted his fierce criticism was out of "frustration", conceding he "overstepped the mark."
"No one wants a situation where students are missing out on their education based on where they live or what school they go to," the statement said.
"The academic research tells us that the remote learning arrangements have the potential to result in poorer educational outcomes for up to half of Australian primary and secondary students if continued for an extended period, in particular the vulnerable, poor, remote and Indigenous students who suffer most.
"It was those examples I was thinking of this morning during my interview on Insiders when I expressed my personal frustration that more schools weren't starting more in-class learning in my home state.
"It was this frustration that led me to overstep the mark in questioning Premier Andrews' leadership on this matter and I withdraw.
"As Education Minister it is my job to take a national view of education and do everything possible to ensure our children are getting the best possible opportunities."
It comes after he criticised the state's decision to keep Victorian schools closed
Mr Tehan had said Mr Andrews' decision to keep schools in his state shut was a "failure of leadership", accusing him of wrecking the "consensus" on the virus response.
"This is a failure of leadership from Dan Andrews. And it is the most disadvantaged children who are being most affected," Mr Tehan said.
"The premiers should listen to the medical experts, the panel that was put together by all state and territory leaders to advise on schools."
"Are you saying that the system, through the National Cabinet, is not delivering the right result?" host David Speers asked.
"It's not. Because we have one premier in particular who is jeopardising the national consensus on this," Mr Tehan said.
He said New South Wales and Queensland both had plans for sending kids back to school.
"Here in Victoria, we don't have one. We have nothing. And it is the children, ultimately in the end, are those most disadvantaged, who are suffering. And I think it's time we called Dan Andrews out on this."
This disagreement between the federal and Victorian governments has been simmering all week, but that interview marks a significant escalation in language from Mr Tehan.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At least on paper...
The AMD Ryzen 9 3950X is an absolute monster when it comes to sheer computing power; its 16 cores and 32 threads will power through any task you throw at it - with aplomb.
With a base clock of 3.5GHz and a staggering 73MB cache, it’s almost a miracle this CPU has a TDP (power dissipation) of 105W. It's certainly a tantalizing prospect for professionals on the hunt for a desktop alternative.
German notebook vendor Schenker has integrated this beast of a CPU into its latest XMG APEX 15 notebook, which is available for €1,958 from Bestware (around $2,130/£1,700/AU$3,300).
Unfortunately, Bestware does not deliver globally, so non-EU customers may have to use a specialist parcel forwarding service if they want to take advantage of the deal. 
The Clevo-source chassis comes with a 144Hz full HD IPS display, an Nvidia Geforce RTX 2060 with 6GB GDDR6, 8GB Kingston memory, a 250GB Kingston A2000 SSD, Bluetooth 5.0 and two-year warranty - but no operating system.
105W is quite a lot of power to dissipate, so the 3950X runs in an eco mode that drops the base speed - via the Ryzen Master software (and possibly in the BIOS) - to about three quarters of its capacity, while consuming 44 percent less power.
Have you managed to get hold of a cheaper product with equivalent specifications, in stock and brand new? Let us know and we'll tip our hat to you. 
This brings up another interesting question: would it be better to buy a cheaper 12 or 8-core CPU instead that comes with a 65W TDP by default?
In any case, the XMG APEX 15 is quite the specimen - and we encourage you to check it out for yourself.

LG E9 OLED (2019) (Image credit: LG)
There are plenty of good-looking OLED TVs around these days, and few look better than those put out by LG. The South Korean TV maker has put an immense amount of thought into its premium OLED range, nowhere more so than with the LG E Series OLED – even if it was sadly discontinued this year.
2019’s LG E9 OLED was a masterclass in panel design, offering a glass display that banished the bezel and almost appeared to be floating up from the counter – offering a truly breathtaking visual experience. More than anything else, it looked different from any other TV put out that year.
The E9 didn’t quite make the cut for 2020, though, with the new Gallery Series GX model replacing the E Series line instead. While it presumably made business sense for LG to cut the E Series – which doesn’t seem to have received nearly the amount of media attention as the cheaper (and equivalently specced) C9 OLED, or the more affordable B9 OLED at the bottom of LG’s 2019 OLED range – it’s a loss nonetheless.
We were disappointed not to see an EX model unveiled at CES 2020 along with the other new LG TVs being shown off, and were told simply that the E Series was no longer being pursued.
Neil Robinson, Senior Director for Strategic Projects at LG Electronics, tells us that “The E and G Series were both step-up models, so the GX can be seen as the replacement for the E9.”
Given how close the LG GX and LG WX are in terms of design – both being slim, wall-mounted televisions, with only really a soundbar to differentiate the latter – the removal of an E Series is a move away from variety, even if the GX will be sure to find an audience of its own.
It’s a shame, given the truly unique aesthetic of the E Series compared to other LG TVs. The new BX and CX models look essentially the same as each other, too, like most televisions these days. How much can you iterate on a flatscreen, after all?
Certainly, there are plenty of subtle differences between the physical appearances of TVs, whether that’s where the TV brand’s logo sits, what kinds of feet or stands prop it up off a counter, or the thickness and quality of the display’s casing. That’s not to mention the differences in picture quality – which is really the heart of any television experience.
But that’s why the E Series felt so refreshing: offering a unique form factor amid a ceaseless catalogue of identikit rectangles. Most of LG's OLED range shares the same panel and processor, anyway, so differences in design feel even more important.
In our LG E9 OLED review last year, we praised the set’s “all-glass, frameless panel” for its “open and expansive air”, as well as “a dazzling picture, with crisp detail and truly cinematic visuals”. Aside from minor irritations – the lack of HDR10+, and a patchy Bluetooth connection – the E9 was and is a knockout television to watch.
The year before? We called the E8 OLED “arguably the ultimate expression of these OLED advances, thanks to its glamorous design, niftily integrated sound system and, best of all, mesmerizingly good pictures.”
Other LG TVs have similarly intriguing design choices – including the TV stand for the C9 OLED, which is slanted to funnel audio towards the viewer – but it’s frustrating to see successful examples of this not pursued further, limited to just one or two model generations.
Our senior home entertainment editor, Nick Pino, speculates that “the reason not to make one this year isn’t based on any pre-existing issues [with the E Series design], but rather that LG decided it couldn’t innovate enough to warrant a new model.”
It’s possible that LG backed itself into a corner with the glass panel design. The TV market demands iteration, and the unique design constraints of a glass display may have meant there was less room to alter or improve its shape going forward compared to other designs (the GX really feels like an iteration on the W Series, rather than a standalone model).
OLED panels are also infamous for often getting damaged during production – given their sensitive, organic materials – and we can’t imagine an all-glass display offsetting worries about breakages either.
The LG E9 OLED is still on sale for those wanting something different – costing roughly half what it did at launch this time last year – and we recommend you take a look if you aren’t sold on the new Gallery Series GX OLED, which offers the only notable divergence from LG’s existing models. Processing enhancements are likely to be minimal compared to the 2020 range too.
But for those of us wanting something different from our televisions, it looks like we’ll have to look elsewhere – whether that’s Samsung’s zero-bezel Q950TS QLED, the rotating Samsung Sero TV, or Hisense’s wacky projector-TV hybrids – to do so.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Renting an AMD EPYC supercomputer is now pretty affordable</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Great for predicting the weather, if you fancy
Cloud computing has democratised access to a host of useful services, such as storage, VPN and web hosting - all of which have become immensely popular and equally cheap.
This has been achieved by opening up almost unlimited compute power, storage and network resources to almost anyone with a credit card to their name. And yes, the principle even extends to supercomputers - well, almost.
Take Microsoft Azure for example; together with Google and Amazon, it is one of the biggest hyperscaler/cloud giants in the world.
Wading through the mind-numbing quantity of options, we found a so-called virtual machine instance (HBv2) that offers 120 CPU cores of AMD’s EPYC 7002 series with 4GB of RAM per core and 900GB of temporary storage.
Now, on its own, 120 CPU cores doesn't challenge even a supercomputer from the beginning of the millennium. But given it only costs $3.60 per hour (a price per core of $0.03), there's nothing preventing you buying 100 such instance - which could allow you to forecast the weather or conduct fluid dynamics analytics, if you're so inclined.
12,000 CPU cores combined packs a rather sizable punch and since the Spot can slash the instance price by nearly 80%, one could say we're almost dealing in pocket change.
Have you managed to get hold of a cheaper product with equivalent specifications? Let us know and we'll tip our hat to you. 
HBv2-series VMs provide up to 350GBps of memory bandwidth, which is up to 50% faster than Intel's x86 and 3x faster than most HPC customers' data center services. HBv2-series VMs also feature 200Gbps HDR InfiniBand from Mellanox.
Note, EPYC instances are only available in some regions and there is currently a supply and demand issue that could mean the product is unavailable.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boosted was developing two bikes and a super-powered electric skateboard</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Sheffer, a tech YouTuber and former staffer at The Verge, posted a video on Friday revealing some unreleased products from the now-defunct electric skateboard startup Boosted, whose assets have been acquired by scooter company Lime and most of the company’s remaining inventory was obtained by a retailer in San Francisco. Sheffer shows images and photos of two bikes, a super-powered electric skateboard, a board with Tony Hawk’s Birdhouse brand, a board with an LED light ring around the edge, and more.
The two different bike models were called the “Bullet” and “P2,” according to Sheffer, and they appear to be electric bikes. However, it’s not clear what type of throttle the bikes used. It’s also unclear what the differences were between the two models, though the Bullet looks to have a bigger battery than the P2. You can take a look at the bikes in the picture below:
Sheffer also obtained what appears to be a mockup of a board called the “Boosted Ultimate,” which looks like a super-powered Boosted longboard. It seems to have four motors, one by each wheel, which would likely have given it fast acceleration and a high top speed.
And here’s a look at that Birdhouse-branded board, thanks to a picture obtained by Sheffer. It looks kind of like a Boosted Mini, and I really like the blue trim and general design of the board.
Boosted was also working on a scooter called the “Boosted Scoot.” Sheffer put the Scoot next to last year’s Rev scooter in the below photo. Although there are some clear cosmetic differences, it’s hard to know exactly how the Scoot may have differed from the Rev, and Sheffer said he’s not sure if Boosted actually made any prototypes of the Scoot.
Sheffer also had images of the “Boosted Little,” which looks as if it may have been a smaller version of the Boosted V2 electric skateboard, and a Boosted board with a white LED light that runs around the edge of the board. Sheffer shared a picture of that LED board, which we have included below. If you want another look, a photo of a Boosted board with a similar-looking red LED trim appeared on Reddit earlier this month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung’s mid-range Galaxy A51 launches on AT&T and Xfinity Mobile</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AT&T and Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile are bringing Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 to their networks this month. The phone, which is the successor to the incredibly popular Galaxy A50, launched on Verizon and Sprint in April. Although Samsung plans to release a 5G version of the handset in the US later this summer, for now only the LTE-variant is available.
There’s a lot packed into the Galaxy A51. The phone comes with four rear cameras, including a main 48-megapixel camera, an ultrawide 12-megapixel camera with a 123-degree field of view, a 5-megapixel macro camera, and a 5-megapixel depth camera. Around the front there’s a 6.5-inch OLED display with a hole-punch notch containing a 32-megapixel selfie camera. There’s also an in-display fingerprint sensor and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Inside is a 4,000 mAh battery, which can be fast-charged at up to 15W, and the phone is powered by an Exynos 9611 processor.
Oh, and it’s also one of the two phones features in an absolutely wild Samsung ad from last year.
Although its flagship Galaxy S lineup generates the most press coverage, recent reports from market research firms Omdia and Counterpoint Research indicate that Samsung’s A-series phones are the ones that more people actually end up buying globally. Back in February, Omdia reported that the Galaxy A50, the predecessor to the A51, was the fourth best-selling smartphone of the year (behind the iPhone XR, iPhone 11, and Galaxy A10) and Counterpoint Research said it was the best-selling smartphone in Europe.
The Galaxy A51 is available to order today from both AT&T and Xfinity Mobile. The device will officially go on sale on Xfinity Mobile on May 8th.
Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.
NEW DELHI: India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on Friday said India - the country with the largest number of people in lockdown - would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 illness, but allow "considerable relaxations" in lower-risk districts.
As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu - meaning Health Bridge - a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country's National Informatics Centre. The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for COVID-19 or deemed to be at high risk.
"Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public," India's Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late on Friday.
It will be the responsibility of the heads of companies and organizations "to ensure 100per cent coverage of this app among the employees," the ministry said.
Officials at India's technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people.
The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India's smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data.
The app's compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app.
"Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body," said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla.
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.
The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used "only for administering necessary medical interventions".
On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.
India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus.

The introduction of new state-of-the-art technology is the latest measure introduced by Abu Dhabi Airports to contain the spread of COVID-19, and aligns with the directives of Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Airports.
This collaboration is part of a broader initiative by Abu Dhabi Airports to integrate the most advanced technologies within its operations, to achieve a high level of efficiency, and provide the best services to its travellers.
The CoDi BOT UGV will be piloted from May throughout Abu Dhabi International Airport, including in staff areas and cargo facilities, as well as being used as part of cabin deserialization processes on passenger aircraft.
Specifically ensuring aircraft cabins are kept clean and sterile, the CoDi BOT UGV is designed to be able to manoeuvre through airplane cabin, which is a unique feature of this product, while ensuring the safety of its operators through remote control capability, using real-time video and high-speed 4G data connection.
“The introduction of the robot helps operational teams carry out safer missions during the sterilisation of aircraft while parked at Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH), eliminating the risk of human exposure and self-contamination. The robot’s versatility also enables the disinfection of spaces within the airport terminals, reinforcing public safety against COVID-19 and any future virus outbreaks,” Abu Dhabi Airports said in a statement.
The UGVs will be operated in conjunction with the extensive range of preventative measures implemented at Abu Dhabi International Airport in response to COVID-19. Measures include thermal screening, nasal swabbing, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, in line with the recommendations by the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP).
“Introducing CoDi BOT UGV at Abu Dhabi International Airport reflects our commitment to adopting innovative technology, which can bolster the protection of our passengers and frontline staff against viruses. The acute impact of the pandemic would have heightened our overall sense of awareness toward hygiene, and as vital piece of public infrastructure, we have a clear responsibility to ensure our spaces remain clear of any virus threat. By deploying artificial intelligence, it adds another layer of protection and builds on our comprehensive response to the COVID-19 outbreak,” said Shareef Hashim Al Hashmi, CEO of Abu Dhabi Airports.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) on Saturday opened the internal roads project at Sama Al Jadaf.
It connects with other main roads in the vicinity, such Al Khail Road to the south, and Shaikh Rashid Road to the north, thus enabling smooth mobility in the area. RTA also opened the internal roads project for Mohammad Bin Rashid Housing Establishment at Oud Al Muteena 1.
“The construction of internal roads at Sama Al Jaddaf is part of our efforts to improve the infrastructure of roads, lighting, and rainwater drainage systems in residential areas to cope with the demographic and urban expansion in the emirate and bring happiness to people. The project included the construction of roads extending 12km, two signalised junctions and street-lighting works,” said Mattar Al Tayer, Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of RTA.
Meanwhile, the construction of internal roads for the Mohammad Bin Rashid Housing Establishment at Oud Al Muteena 1 extended 7km. The project is linked with the surrounding roads network to ensure smooth mobility of road users from and to surrounding areas. Works included street-lighting, roadside parking and pedestrian pavements.
“RTA has completed 47 per cent of construction works in internal roads at Al Khawaneej 2. The network spans 77km, including single-lane roads – 68km – and dual collector roads – 9km. The project works included rainwater drainage, electricity and water, and street-lighting,” added Al Tayer.

Launched as part of the ’10 million meals’ campaign, the World’s Tallest Donation Box enables companies, entities and the public to purchase one of the 1.2 million lights on the Burj Khalifa, for as little as Dh10 each, to collectively donate 1.2 million meals or food parcels to individuals and families affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the UAE.
For every light purchased for Dh10 through the website www.tallestdonationbox.com, one meal is provided to someone in need, as part of the UAE’s social efforts to support the most vulnerable against the economic and humanitarian challenges posed by the global pandemic.
The initiative aims to ignite the 1.2 million lights on the façade of the world’s tallest building, reflecting social solidarity and cohesion of the UAE’s diverse society to bring much-needed relief to coronavirus-hit communities across the country.
Individuals can purchase pixels (LED lights) on Burj Khalifa for as little as Dh10 each and donate a meal for low-income individuals and families in the UAE through the website www.tallestdonationbox.com.The number of meals donors provide is relative to the number of lights they purchase.
Individuals can provide their name and details and select the donation amount on the website or donate by selecting their preferred number of meals to purchase.
A countdown will be displayed on Burj Khalifa’s façade and the initiative’s website to track donations raised in real-time.
Donors will be able to share the pixels they bought on their social media to spread the word and encourage their followers to join the initiative and help provide meals for those most affected by the global pandemic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Digital technologies play a major role in accelerating the global response to the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansoori, UAE Minister of Economy on Sunday.
Participating in the extraordinary G20 Digital Economy Ministerial Meeting, which was attended by economic ministers of all G20 member states under the presidency of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
Al Mansoori said while the countries of the world are joining forces to deal with the repercussions of the COVID-19 outbreak and address the impact of the pandemic on various development sectors, most importantly public health and economic sectors, the significant role of digital technologies and related policies in driving these efforts have come to the fore.
The meeting discussed the role of digital technologies in enhancing business resilience and preserving jobs, lives and the global economy. In addition to setting options for policies to support the digital transformation of business models during the pandemic period, the development of policies for digital infrastructure, ICT-based innovation, ways to harness digital technologies to serve the society, as well as the role of digital economy in the creation of jobs and spurring economic growth were also discussed.
During the meeting, Al Mansoori explained that the UAE has made great progress in the field of digital transformation and has adopted Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, especially artificial intelligence, and its applications to drive the growth of the country’s vital sectors.
He said the most important measures taken by the UAE to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the business sector and to enable business continuity. The country is capitalizing on its advanced technological and smart infrastructure to ensure business continuity at both governmental and private levels, he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Run on toilets leaves Japanese lavatory makers flush with orders</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak triggered twin bouts of panic buying in Japan — of toilet paper and of the toilets themselves as building wholesalers competed to secure the precious commodity.
The rapid rise in demand for lavatories and an accompanying sudden nationwide shortage of them from mid-March was the result of market participants attempting to “game” the system ahead of rivals as Chinese factories closed and supply chains dried up. 
The panic buying was prompted by a fear among housebuilders that they would be unable to declare any new property liveable without a secure supply of the vital equipment, said manufacturers.
At its peak, said Kinya Seto, the chief executive of the bathroom and building equipment maker Lixil, some wholesalers were placing orders for 10 times more product than they actually required — a tactic that spurred rivals to respond with even larger orders.
“When people began to realise that there might be a shortage, many of the customers began to order. Where they needed 100 toilets, next time they asked for 400,” Mr Seto said in an interview. “Whether it’s toilet paper or masks, it’s the same thing. People began to make bigger orders.” 
March is usually the busiest season for toilet demand in Japan with people moving houses ahead of the start of the new financial and school year. About 80 per cent of Japanese households use high-end “smart toilets” with auto-warming seats and bidet sprays, a market that generated about $790m in domestic sales in 2019, according to government data.
But this year, demand spiked as Toto, Japan’s biggest toilet maker with seven plants across China, became the first to flag potential shipment delays in mid-February, prompting some wholesalers to place large orders to secure the remaining inventory.
Global interest in Japan’s smart toilets, which have long struggled to catch on in western markets, has also increased in the coronavirus era as people seek higher standards of sanitation and hygiene.

With the shutdown of its plants, some Toto customers turned to Lixil, which was able to partially offset the disruptions in China with plants in other parts of Asia and existing inventory. Lixil boosted its manufacturing capacity by 10 to 20 per cent but it too stopped taking new orders in February till late March as production failed to meet demand. 
Toto said demand for its toilets had been particularly strong from before the outbreak due to a new product launch and it was unable to determine whether there were specific coronavirus-related new orders.
Mr Seto acknowledged the coronavirus surge was a temporary phenomenon. “Once Toto comes back, all of that demand will evaporate. That’s where many manufacturers make a mistake. People tend to anticipate it’s going to last forever but it’s not going to,” he said.
Toto has already resumed production in China but capacity has not fully recovered due to declining demand.
Last week, the company reported an 82 per cent collapse in profits for the January to March quarter. Meanwhile, Lixil delayed its earnings release as it reported a 30 per cent year-on-year decline in product shipments on average for its international housing and water businesses in April.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So what’s next for Stadia after rolling out 4K streaming on the web, and 5.1 surround sound for players using a browser? According to code 9to5Google dug up in the app, Google is preparing to add the option for 4K and HDR-quality streaming on Android-powered TVs, as well as built-in messaging to rival other modern gaming services.
The ability to share captures as a link, or view lists of achievements also serve to match the likes of PSN and Xbox Live. There’s no indication about whether these features are close enough to release that players trying out its two free months will see them before deciding on a subscription, but we can hope.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sonos is reportedly giving the Playbar a long-awaited redesign</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You’d be forgiven for thinking that Sonos had forgotten about the Playbar — while it’s been happy to introduce newer hardware like the Beam and Playbase, its original soundbar still has that 2013-era design and core functionality. At last, though, Sonos appears ready to give the Playbar a makeover. Zatz Not Funny has obtained what it says are “incomplete” renders of a redesigned Playbar. It’s not clear what physical ports the leaked bar would have, but it looks to be a much sleeker, curvier design that would feel more at home with modern TVs. A 9to5Mac tipster hinted at possible Dolby Atmos support, which might explain the new design — it’d need a place to put upward-firing speakers.
It’s not clear what connectivity the new Playbar would have, but it’s safe to say it would catch up with more recent Sonos devices to add features like AirPlay 2 streaming. It’s also possible you’ll see native voice control, although we certainly wouldn’t plan around it at this stage. You can be sure of support for Sonos S2, at least.
The ZNF leak didn’t mention release dates or pricing. This suggests Sonos is getting relatively close, though. Just be prepared to pay a hefty amount. The existing Playbar still has an official $749 price tag, and we wouldn’t expect it to dip below that given audio and connectivity upgrades. Not that this will necessarily be a problem. As with the Beam, the new Playbar might serve as a combination soundbar and high-end smart speaker that could ultimately save you money.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boosted's planned products included e-bikes and an 'Ultimate' skateboard</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boosted as you know it is no more, but it apparently had ambitious plans before Lime snapped up its assets. YouTuber Sam Sheffer has obtained images of what the company had been working on before its effective shutdown, and it was clearly keen to expand into new areas. There were two e-bikes in development, the “P2” and the likely longer-ranged “Bullet” — you could have had a serious commuting machine.
The plans also included upgrades to Boosted’s core electric skateboard line. There was a quad-motor “Ultimate” board for enthusiasts who wanted a ridiculously powerful four-wheeler, while a “Little” board would have improved on the Boosted Mini with a more comfortable ride. A Tony Hawk-themed board was even in the works, Sheffer said, although an LED-lined board appears to have an older prototype. And if you thought the Boosted Rev was overkill, a more modest scooter was also in the cards.
It’s not certain if Lime will do anything with these projects, although e-bikes and e-scooters would fit into its transportation plans. We wouldn’t count on the boards being made — not unless Lime wants to expand into that market, at least. If nothing else, this shows what could have been if Boosted had lasted a while longer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India requires all workers to use its COVID-19 tracking app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COVID-19 contact tracing apps are frequently voluntary in those countries that have rolled them out so far, but India’s is effectively mandatory. The country’s home ministry will require that all workers, public or private, use its Aarogya Setu app starting May 4th. Company and government leaders will be responsible for enforcing adoption, officials said, and there will be “punishment” if there’s negligence.
The app has already been downloaded 80 million times, and the aim is to not only reach every smartphone user in the country (about 350 million) but reach basic phone users through an interactive voice system.
Like in other countries, widespread adoption of contact tracing apps could prove vital to curbing the spread of the new coronavirus. They might reduce or eliminate the need for further lockdowns while humanity waits for a vaccine. However, governments have generally shied away from requiring these apps, in part to assuage fears they might be used for mass surveillance. India clearly isn’t as worried about public perception.
Privacy activists aren’t happy, to no one’s surprise. Although the app relies on anonymous device identities and stores encrypted records of Bluetooth interactions with other devices, the Internet Freedom Foundation said the app doesn’t meet data protection standards or provide enough transparency for algorithms. Mozilla warned that it wasn’t certain how Aarogya Setu’s data would be used, and that there weren’t sufficient privacy laws to protect the public. This won’t necessarily lead to abuses of power, but there might not be much to stop those misuses if they do occur.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung's $399 Galaxy A51 comes to AT&T and Xfinity Mobile</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung’s Galaxy A51 is a viable alternative to the iPhone SE if you’re looking for a mid-priced phone, but you’ve been out of luck if you wanted to get it through a carrier besides Sprint or Verizon (Engadget’s parent company). You won’t have to wait longer for more options, though. AT&T and Xfinity Mobile have announced (via The Verge) that they’re carrying the A51, with orders open now. This is the LTE model rather than the 5G variant due in the summer, but you might not mind given the $399 price and lack of ubiquitous 5G coverage.
The A51 is running on a middling Exynos 9611 chip and doesn’t boast the zoom photography, wireless charging or 120Hz displays of the Galaxy S20 series, but it still offers a lot for the money. The 6.5-inch 1080p OLED screen, quad rear cameras (48MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 5MP macro and 5MP depth), sizeable 4,000mAh battery and headphone jack should tick some of the biggest checkboxes for many users. This is for people who want the essence of a modern Samsung phone and aren’t particularly worried about performance.
Verizon owns Engadget's parent company, Verizon Media. Rest assured, Verizon has no control over our coverage. Engadget remains editorially independent.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WATCH | Medical graduate joins Covid-19 front line, thanks to crowdfunding effort</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After battling to graduate for two years due to unpaid university fees, clinical associate Retshidisitswe Kotane, finally found her happy ending when she was deployed to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) which is at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19.
Kotane was finally able to register with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) at the beginning of February, after a crowdfunding initiative on the Feenix crowdfunding platform raised R92 000 so that she could settle her outstanding fees.
The clinical associate is now employed at Netcare Linksfield hospital, and works at the NICD as part of the virology team of professionals testing for Covid-19. 
Kotane told News24 she still couldn't believe how everything worked out after waiting for many years to realise her dream of working in the healthcare industry. 
"It feels unreal. I feel like someone is going to wake me up," she said.
She added that she had been volunteering her skills for nearly two years because she was "passionate" about her work.
"I was happy to volunteer just to put my skill and knowledge to practice."
"It feels unreal, especially to be part of this team. It's the NICD for crying out loud. I didn't see myself here. I thought I'd always be at a local clinic or private GP, but I'm here...I still don't believe it," the clinical associate said.

Kotane said she had to raise the funds to pay off her university fees so she could register with the HPCSA. Mere days after registering, she received a call about an offer - a locum contract at a private clinic. 
"I don't know how I got that call, but I just got a call that said there is a locum contract. If I was interested, could I start immediately," she said.
Three days into the locum contract, she received another phone call, with even better news - an opportunity to work at the NICD. 
Kotane said that although being at the front line of the pandemic has meant that she was unable to see her family, she was happy to be able to learn from the NICD and being part of a historical moment for humankind. 
"I'm excited to be learning so much, to be a part of something this big. I mean, it has shut the whole world. I love it, I'm enjoying it. I think I'm the only one who is always happy to come here," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk says he is 'selling almost all physical possessions' and Tesla share price is too high in latest bizarre Twitter spree</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elon Musk's will sell "almost all" his physical possessions and said that his own company is overvalued in a string of bizarre Twitter posts.
The outburst comes in the wake of widely criticised comments about the lockdown, which he called "fascistic" and suggested should be lifted to give America its "freedom".
Mr Musk echoed those calls in his latest posts, writing "now give people back their FREEDOM" before going on to post a series of tweets quoting the US national anthem.
"I am selling almost all physical possessions," the first of the posts read. "Will own no house."
Mr Musk then went onto write "Tesla stock price is too high imo". The comments appeared to lead the share price to drop immediately, falling 10 per cent in the wake of the posts.
"Now give people back their FREEDOM," the third post read. Mr Musk then posted the final lines of the US national anthem.
In recent days, many of Mr Musk's posts have criticised the government lockdown and attempted to suggest that the public are misled over the scale of the coronavirus crisis.
In a flurry of tweets earlier this week, he posted "FREE AMERICA NOW" and "Give people their freedom back".
He also used a Tesla earnings call to attack the lockdown as "fascistic" as part of a impassioned diatribe.
Mr Musk has been known to use his Twitter account to post controversial and unusual messages in the past.
He has said in the past that the strange nature of those messages has led to Twitter locking his account, fearing that they had been posted by a hacker.
The impact of the Tesla chief executive's tweets on his company's share price has led to suggestions that his tweets should be reviewed before they are posted, though Mr Musk later claimed that was not happening because of "freedom of speech".
The popularity of Mr Musk's Twitter account – which has 33 million followers – has led to it becoming a key focus for hackers and scammers. But they have largely attempted to do that by impersonating him, including taking control of other verified accounts and making them look as if they were Mr Musk's official account.
The new outburst came as Nasa announced that one of Mr Musk's other companies, SpaceX, was one of three firms in the running to make the lunar lander for humanity's return to the moon's surface. SpaceX already has a number of key contracts with the US government, including one that will see it send Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station in a matter of weeks.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Galaxy M21 was launched in India in March, and the pricing of the phone started from INR 12,999. However, after the Indian government hiked taxes (GST) on smartphones in the country last month, Samsung had to increase the pricing of its devices accordingly, including the Galaxy M21. Now, the pricing of the mid-range device has been dropped again.
Samsung has dropped the price of the 64GB variant of the Galaxy M21 from INR 14,222 to INR 13,199. The price of the 128GB variant of the phone has been decreased from INR 16,499 to INR 15,499. The phone will be available for purchase from Amazon.in once the COVID-19 lockdown in India ends in the next few days.
The Galaxy M21 features a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED Infinity-U display with Full HD resolution and a 20MP front-facing camera. At the rear, the phone has a 48MP+8MP+5MP triple-camera setup as well as a capacitive fingerprint reader. A 6000mAh battery powers the phone, and there’s support for 15W fast wired charging.
The phone runs Android 10 with One UI 2.0 and is equipped with the Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM, 64GB/128GB storage, and a microSD card slot. The Galaxy M21 features a dual-SIM card slot, LTE, Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, USB Type-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features Dolby Atmos audio and Face Unlock, and it comes in two colors: Black and Blue.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung is aware of Galaxy Chromebook’s battery life problem, working on a fix</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung launched the Galaxy Chromebook, arguably the best-looking Chrome OS laptop ever, four months ago. It has a beautiful red aluminum body, a 4K Super AMOLED touchscreen with DisplayHDR 400, and an S Pen. However, its battery doesn’t last as long as Samsung’s marketing claims, and the company is aware of this issue.
Most Galaxy Chromebook reviews praised the laptop’s vibrant design and fantastic screen, but they also pointed out its below-par battery life despite the Project Athena certification. Samsung is reportedly fully aware of the Galaxy Chromebook’s battery life issues. The company isn’t sitting idly, and it is working with Google to pinpoint the reason for the laptop’s low battery life.
There is still no confirmation as to how Google and Samsung will solve this issue, and when a software update would be rolled out. The report states that the South Korean electronics giant is working on the battery life issue as a high priority, so the update should come sooner than later.
To remind you, the Galaxy Chromebook uses the Intel Core i5 10210U processor, which is a U series model with 15W TDP. On the other hand, most other Chromebooks use Intel’s Y-series processors with 5W TDP. Its 4K OLED screen doesn’t help either, consuming a lot of power while churning out over 700 nits of brightness in specific scenarios.
The companies could be working on a newer CPU power governer so that the processor consumes less power while doing lighter tasks. Google and Samsung could also use the laptop’s Ambient EQ sensor to lower the screen brightness in indoor conditions so that the display sips power from the 49.2Wh battery rather than gulping it.
If you’ve purchased the $1,000 Galaxy Chromebook, let us know your experience with the laptop’s performance and battery life via the comments section below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Galaxy A51 now available through Xfinity Mobile in the US</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Although the Galaxy A51 was unveiled in December last year, the phone was announced for the US market only last month. The mid-range smartphone first became available through AT&T, Samsung, Sprint, and Verizon, and now, the Galaxy A51 can also be purchased through Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile.
If you’re thinking of picking up the Galaxy A51 from Xfinity Mobile in the US, you should know that it is currently available only in one color: Prism Crush Black. It is priced at $399 for the 4GB RAM + 128GB storage variant.
If you opt for a 24-month contract, the phone can be yours for just $12.5 per month, which turns out to a total cost of $300. However, you need to transfer your number or get a new line to get the $100 discount. The estimated delivery date for the Galaxy A51 is listed as May 8.
The Galaxy A51 features a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screen with Full HD+ resolution and an under-display fingerprint reader. It runs Android 10 and uses the Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB RAM, 128GB storage, and has a microSD card slot.
The phone has a 32MP selfie camera on the front and a 48MP+12MP+5MP+5MP quad-camera setup on the rear. The Galaxy A51 is powered by a 4,000mAh battery and supports 15W fast charging via a USB Type-C port. If you’re interested in the smartphone, you can read our Galaxy A51 review here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">With wearing masks now a daily routine, I miss Samsung’s iris scanner</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung gets a lot of things right with its flagships, but in recent years, biometrics haven’t been one of them. The capacitive fingerprint sensor on Galaxy flagships changed positions a few times between the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S9, and it failed to be as convenient as the front-facing sensor that Samsung had been using before. Samsung then switched to an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint reader with the Galaxy S10, and we all know that sensor is not as amazing as the company had made it out to be.
Facial recognition is the other biometric solution we find on Galaxy flagships today. However, it’s not something that works all of the time. It also can’t be used for security inside apps because facial recognition with a regular camera is easy to fool. And in our current times, when you can’t step out of the house without a mask on, facial recognition is turning out to be quite useless and making me miss the iris scanner Samsung’s flagships used to have back before the Galaxy S10 came around.
India has been under lockdown since March 25. Unless you need to buy medicine, grocery, and other essential items, it’s not recommended to step out. But my father had fallen ill a couple of months ago, and though he is almost back to full health now, his recovery phase over the last couple of weeks has necessitated quite a few trips to the hospital. I have been out of the house a lot in recent weeks as a result, both for grocery shopping and for those hospital trips, and wearing a mask has become almost a daily routine for me.
And, well, you probably know where I’m going with this. With facial recognition failing to work with a mask on, I’ve had to fall back to using the fingerprint sensor on my Galaxy S20 Ultra all the time, at least when I’m out. That wouldn’t have been a problem if Samsung was still equipping its flagships with an iris scanner. Sadly, that isn’t the case, mainly because every manufacturer is chasing the dream of truly bezel-free displays, which leaves no space for anything but a regular front-facing camera in our smartphone screens.
The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works well most of the time, but having an iris scanner would have been a lot more convenient. It would be great if Samsung could implement an option that allows facial recognition to register your face and work with a mask on. That wouldn’t be very secure and could be very, very easy to fool. But desperate times call for desperate measures – we can’t get those iris scanners back, so how about a middle-of-the-road solution that makes unlocking our phones with masks on less of a hassle?
What do you think?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung not shifting phone production to Vietnam as Korea overcomes COVID19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When the COVID19 pandemic first began, South Korea was the country hit the hardest after China. The virus has since caused havoc across the globe while strict measures taken by the South Korean government have enabled the company to put a lid on the situation.
Samsung’s manufacturing facilities had to suffer shutdowns due to confirmed coronavirus cases. At one point, it was reported that the company was planning to shift premium phone production to Vietnam to offset delays at its Gumi plant in South Korea. However, Samsung appears to have given up on that idea as South Korea is now one of the few countries where the COVID19 situation is under control.
The Gumi plant in South Korea is where Samsung’s premium smartphones like the Galaxy Fold and Galaxy Z Flip are manufactured. It had to be shut down for a couple of days due to confirmed COVID19 cases. The bulk of its smartphone manufacturing is still done in Vietnam and the company was thinking about temporarily moving the production of these devices to the country as well.
The COVID19 situation in South Korea was much worse at that time so it would have made sense for the company to do that in order to ensure that it could continue to put these phones on the market. The virus had struck not long after the Galaxy Z Flip was launched so it was important for Samsung to ensure a steady supply of its new foldable smartphone.
Reports out of South Korea suggest that Samsung has withdrawn this plan because the situation is now under control in its home country even as the virus causes disruption across the globe. Earlier this week, South Korea reported no locally transmitted cases of the virus, a highly commendable achievement.
If anything, there’s now the expectation that the Gumi plant will be able to plug the production gap for other markets should the pandemic cause disruption at some of Samsung’s other manufacturing facilities across the globe.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gigabyte: Intel Z490 motherboards will support 11th-gen Core Rocket Lake CPUs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel's latest 10th generation Comet Lake-S CPUs are going to be rather power-hungry, especially at the high end. And since they require a new, LGA 1200 socket, gamers and enthusiasts will want to pair these with Z490 motherboards, which are going to be expensive in all but their most modest incarnations.
Z490 motherboards bring with them a number of new features, most notably support for PCIe 4.0 and much improved wired and wireless networking chipsets, depending on model. Some of them will run you north of $700, so the obvious question on everyone's mind is: Will these motherboards support Intel's next generation CPUs which are slated for a 2021 launch? The answer is yes. At least 11th-gen Rocket Lake S support is apparently guaranteed.
Gigabyte recently confirmed this during its latest Aorus Direct livestream. For those of you who like future-proofing your build as much as possible, knowing that Z490 motherboards will support Rocket Lake processors can certainly offer some peace of mind. AMD has had a ton of success with this strategy with Ryzen and the AM4 socket.
For those unaware, Intel didn't bake in PCIe 4.0 support into the Z490 chipset or Comet Lake CPUs that you'll be able to buy this year. And while graphics cards aren't even touching the limits of PCIe 3.0, it's a different story if you're interested in taking advantage of PCIe 4.0 SSDs.
The next-gen Rocket Lake CPUs will come with 20 PCIe 4.0 lanes, which is why manufacturers like Gigabyte are touting support for that in their marketing materials. It's worth noting that the Gigabyte rep that confirmed the support for Rocket Lake in Z490 motherboards was hesitant about giving out the information, which suggests that Intel may not have wanted to reveal this at this point.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This graphics processor is strange. As you can see from the image, from the outside it’s more like a CPU than a GPU. It sits in a socket using almost three thousand pins. It has an integrated heat spreader.
Inside, it’s like nothing we've seen before. Using the AA battery for scale, the chip is about 4000mm2. If the active area is half that size, that's three times the size of an RTX 2080 Ti. It has “tens of billions” of transistors, while the RTX 2080 Ti has just under twenty billion.
But what sort of GPU is it? For the time being, this processor eludes classification as the information Intel has provided is contradictory. Koduri previously said that the “father of all” is a Xe HP (high performance) product. Later on, he would also mention this chip supports BF16, a very niche AI acceleration compute format. BF16 is a confirmed, exclusive feature of Xe HPC (high performance compute). This chip could therefore be a Xe HPC product...
Baap means father in Hindi, and Baahubali is a mythical hero of sorts. Xe is being developed in India.
The difference between the two is substantial. Xe HP is oriented towards gaming and workstations. Leaks pin the core counts at between 1024 and 4096. Xe HPC is for servers and optimized for AI and scientific work. The single HPC product under development is codenamed Ponte Vecchio, it is said to have 1024 cores, but is by far the most powerful accelerator Intel is developing by virtue of its complex memory subsystem and the variety of cores and operations it supports. You can read more about this in our in-depth breakdown on Xe.
While neither HP nor HPC can be ruled out definitively, the nature of the latter seems more suitable to the new mystery processor. It would be quite strange for a gaming/workstation processor to be prototyped in a socket-based format, whereas Ponte Vecchio has already been depicted in what could be a socket.
Further, from early schematics and presentations, Ponte Vecchio could be expected to be unprecedentedly large due to the inclusion of the high-footprint RAMBO cache and onboard HBM2 (or HBM2E). There is no reason to expect a HP product to be so large.
Regardless of what exactly this GPU is, the “father of all” will undoubtedly have the mother of all price tags, so you’d better start saving. Xe HP will release sometime this year and Ponte Vecchio will be ready in late 2021.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel's Raja Koduri confirms that massive 'father of all' GPU is aimed at the data center</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel tweeted a photo teasing a massive and mysterious GPU on Friday, and in doing so, lit the internet aflame with speculation. Early on, pretty much everyone settled on it being a form of Intel's upcoming Xe HP or Xe HPC. As a reminder, Intel's Xe Graphics architecture will span three derivatives: Xe LP, Xe HP, and Xe HPC.
Intel's own Raja Koduri seemingly straddled the fence between Xe HP and Xe HPC with a tweet, saying "The 'baap of all' is back, battle-fielding and b-floating." The "battle-fielding" seemed to suggest some sort of consumer or prosumer facing product, indicating Xe HP. Although, the "b-floating" suggested that the GPU was more aligned with Xe HPC.
The "b-floating" remark refers to the bfloat16 floating-point format, which is mainly used for deep learning and AI acceleration. While BF16 is key to Intel's supercomputer and HPC strategy, Intel is also adopting BF16 support for its upcoming Cooper Lake-SP Xeons via the AVX-512 BF16 extensions.
Initially, there was some speculation that this GPU -- housed inside of a massive LGA package replete with an IHS -- could be Intel's 7nm Ponte Vecchio, destined for the Aurora Supercomputer in 2021. However, by early guesstimates, the GPU being teased looks to have four compute chiplets and four stacks of HBM2e memory. That would rule out Ponte Vecchio.
More importantly, Koduri has now confirmed that this GPU is indeed a slice of Intel's Xe HP silicon (and not Xe HPC/Ponte Vecchio), and is targeted at data centers. With that Koduri has put to rest certain conjectures that assumed this card would be aimed at consumers and would outperform products that don't currently exist.
Although, Koduri also dropped another tease, suggesting that an even bigger GPU could succeed this one. "This was called the 'baap of all' by our team....The 'Baahubali of all' is baking as well," said Koduri in a tweet.
Best anyone can tell, Koduri's "Baahubali" reference is loosely referring to an Indian hero/epic action movie he was involved with, suggesting that the "father of all" will be succeeded by something even more substantial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk, EPA at odds over mileage range for Tesla Model S sedan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Once again, Elon Musk has put his foot in his mouth.
The man branded Tech Covidiot No.1 for tweeting dubious claims about the coronavirus, said in an earnings call this week that the Environmental Protection Agency made a mistake when it tested his new Model S sedan — resulting in a lower mileage range then Tesla had stated.
“We increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X,” Musk said during the call. “Actually, we said that, actually, the model — the real Model S range is 400 miles, but when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, [EPA] left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car — and it did this overnight. And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its range. And as a result, it had a 391 test.
“As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we’re actually confident that we will achieve a 400-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months — the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles,” he continued.
But the EPA shot back at Musk, and said he is mistaken.
“We can confirm that EPA tested the vehicle properly, the door was closed, and we are happy to discuss any technical issues with Tesla, as we do routinely with all automakers,” the EPA said in a statement to The Verge.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Southwest Airlines CEO claims it’s safe to fly despite coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The CEO of Southwest Airlines claimed Sunday that it’s safe to fly again despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Speaking on “Face the Nation” on CBS, Gary Kelly said the airline had taken extreme measures to ensure passengers would be safe from the COVID-19 virus and that the company’s jets were “as safe as humanly possible.”
“We’re doing everything possible to encourage people to come back and fly,” Kelly told Margaret Brennan. “We’re cleaning airplanes, we’re requiring masks of our employees and our customers, we’re using very deep cleaning overnight, we’re using electrostatic misters which will kill the virus on surfaces for up to 30 days.”
“We’re exercising social distancing on board the aircraft,” Kelly said. “We won’t be booking airplanes full so that people can spread out. So, absolutely we’re doing everything we can to make it as safe as humanly possible.”
Kelly’s remarks come after other major airlines, including Delta, United, American, and JetBlue, announced that passengers would be required to wear protective masks on flights and that other safety measures against the coronavirus would be put in place.
The airline industry has been hard hit by the virus, which has reduced air travel to a bare minimum amid lockdowns and travel restrictions — and Southwest is no exception.
Kelly said nearly 400 of the airline’s fleet has been grounded during the lockdown.
“The demand is not there,” he told Brennan. “So, obviously if things don’t improve we have to downsize.”
“We’ve never had a furlough in our history, we’ve never had a pay cut in our history, and I’m extraordinarily proud of that. We certainly don’t want to break that record. What I had promised our people is I don’t know what the future holds but I do know that we are very well prepared.”
He said the last measure for the financially strapped air carrier would be involuntary furloughs for the airline’s more than 60,000 employees.

The Director General, National Information Technology Development Agency, Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi (NITDA) says Nigerians must learn to adopt digital economy because it is the only economy that works in this  COVID-19 era.
He therefore stated that the best approach to adopt at post COVID-19 world is to think Digital First.
By adopting digital first approach, he averred that recovery from the crisis and adaptation to the new order would become seamless because “our behaviour is going to change as many things would have changed.”
The NITDA DG made the call  while speaking as guest speaker of a webinar with the theme “Dealing with Corona Virus: Digital First Perspective” organised by Nile University of Nigeria in conjunction with NITDA.
According to him, the outbreak of pandemic has created a new world order which is making things to be done differently.
“We need to look at what work for us and create strategies that will make us embrace it and adapt it after COVID-19.”
“We need to think Digital First in order to provide us with something to fall back on if there is second wave of this pandemic,” he added.
The only economy that works in ‘In-COVID’ era is digital economy and luckily the present administration has prepared Nigeria for the impact the virus would have on the physical economy with different governmental initiatives.
Abdullahi said; “the only economy that works is digital economy, physical economy has shut down. In November last year, the president unveiled the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for a Digital Nigeria and also in March this year, the president launched Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training which aimed at building the capability of Nigerians towards achieving Digital Economy,” he added.
He argued that digital technologies offer rays of hope as there are increase in the usage of different applications that support digital technology according to the World Economic Forum WEF, adding that; “everybody is trying to connect remotely and virtually by embracing digital technologies especially zoom and Microsoft Teams platforms.”
“In Nigeria, we are using digital technology to keep businesses up and running. Technologies are being deployed by restaurants and banks; you can imagine being in this crisis without digital technology, we are going to be in total lockdown”, he said.
While recounting what NITDA has achieved during the period of lockdown, Mallam Abdullahi said the Agency has commenced Virtual Learning through NITDA academy, an online platform that can be used to learn various skills for every interested Nigerians. The Agency also organised Start Up Clinics, inaugurated Tech4Covid Advisory Committee and launched Nigeria COVID-19 Innovation Challenge, among others.
He maintained that in every situation, there is a silver lining to be explored by people, adding that COVID 19 has provided such silver lining which includes; the creation of disinfection devices, remote work, ghost kitchen and service business services.
He further advised the participants to become entrepreneurs in order to explore the silver lining provided by the COVID-19 crisis. “We need to have entrepreneurial mindset. We need to inspire others too and have passion for whatever we are doing because what we do is going to change the new world order,” he said.
Earlier in his welcome remarks, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof Osman Nuri Aras explained that the institution is adopting digital platforms to carry on with learning and other academic activities.
“All school activities will go ahead as planned. We are trying to do our best to see that the situation we find ourselves today won’t disrupt our educational activities and we are assuring parents and students that we will continue to provide educational services during this period.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
South Africa is seeking to create a new thriving national airline out of the ashes of its current state-owned carrier, which is technically insolvent and on the brink of being placed in liquidation by administrators.
South African Airways (SAA) has recorded no profit since 2011 and has survived through government bailouts.
An ideal replacement for South African Airways would have both public and private owners, maintain the country’s trade connections and make a profit, the department of public enterprises said in a statement on Friday.
The embattled national carrier has been involuntary business rescue since December last year.
The rescue practitioners late last month said the airline cannot survive beyond month-end, and the choices left are either a forced liquidation or a winding down process.
All its flights have been grounded since South Africa closed its borders and went into a five-week nationwide Covid-19 lockdown in March which has made the survival of SAA, which employs 5,200 employees, even more uncertain.
The airline’s troubles were further worsened last month when the government refused to pay yet another 10 billion rand (531 million dollars) in emergency aid to the company, claiming resources had been stretched by the coronavirus pandemic.
“Stakeholders (…) have agreed on a long-term vision and strategy” with a view to “the creation of a new dynamic airline,” public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan said.
The minister said it will not be the old SAA but the beginning of a new journey towards the constitution of a newly restructured company which will be the new standard of South Africa. The new carrier is set to compete in the post-COVID-19 world.
According to the statement, SAA employees will be transitioned and new leadership and equity partners will be sought.
The demise of SAA would mark an end of era for the 86-year old airline which had gone through years of financial troubles associated and high debt associated with poor management.

In a bid to transform the minds of Africa’s public figures and sensitise them to change their community positively, New Generation Africa platform has intensified discussions to engage young people.
Created by Daniel Ogoloma, the platform has since increased its engagement following the COVID-19 pandemic as more people are at home.
According to Ogoloma, the platform has hosted educative and impactful conversations with individuals from all professions including actors, musicians, politicians, entertainers and economists.
Ogoloma stressed that while a lot of the time, public figures and celebrities are looked at as selfish individuals that merely prey on the masses for a paycheck, these conversations give them the opportunity to express themselves and let their fans know their current and future outreach missions that will empower the next generation.
Having hosted politicians on his platform, @dcogoloma, he said: “They all seem to have the same stance and that is to ensure that young people actually have the ability to be in office and aren’t just zealous.
“These amazing politicians stressed that should any young person have the right CV and merit to be in office, then it is the job of the potential candidate’s party chairman to place them in the right position based on this not based on the size of their pockets.”
He noted that for more young people to drive the change they desire, they need to stop thinking about their age and what opportunities they might have lost, but rather be good at something as opportunity is imminent.
Ogoloma added: “If a footballer is good, they play regardless of age. If they aren’t good they don’t play. Young people need to stop talking about age and start thinking about the level they need to be at.”

The young entrepreneur and advocate for good governance encouraged all young people to partner with the government and NGOs to volunteer.
“It’s imperative we who are young, healthy and strong make the effort to contribute in helping our communities to the best of our ability,” he added.
He said while young people do not need any specific skills to achieve a new Africa, “however, the youths must imbibe the three principles of sacrifice, loyalty to the cause and do better than yesterday’s efforts.
“The Oxford University student added that there is an awakening; a huge burgeoning new interest in where mankind started. Today, Africa is much more than the greatest emerging economy, luring interest and investment. Now is the future.
“That future is not dependent on handouts and good intention from the West and the rest. That future should not, and cannot, be the brutal assets stripping of the past.
“It’s a tightly geared future, inextricably linked to opportunities both within and beyond its shores.”

Consumer Reports has analyzed the privacy policies of Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and WebEx and discovered that they may be collecting more data than many people realize.
To be clear: Consumer Reports isn’t saying that these apps are unsafe to use. (Indeed, a separate Mozilla report found that nearly every major videoconferencing app meets basic security standards.) But by agreeing to the privacy policies of these services, you are giving companies like Google and Microsoft access to plenty of personal data.
According to the report, all three companies reserve the right to collect information from your calls, including how long a call lasts, who’s participating in the call, and the IP addresses of everyone taking part.
As the world has become more reliant on videoconferencing tools, people have also started to scrutinize the security measures and privacy policies of these services.
And while not as alarming as the security holes in Zoom that came to light in April, leading to a host of “Zoombombing” and other concerns, it’s still worth being aware of the data that Microsoft, Google, and Cisco can collect.
None of the companies mentioned go into specific details on what kind of data is actually being collected or how it’s being used. Consumer Reports does note that the data collected here could be combined with information from other sources to create personal profiles on users and their use habits, or even potentially use videos for things like training facial recognition systems.
All three companies told Consumer Reports that they only create video recordings or transcripts when participants request them by recording the meetings and promised that the recordings aren’t “directly” used for advertising.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ISRO’s Gaganyaan: COVID-19 interrupts future of the mission; check details</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The training of the four Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots who are in Russia for 11 months of advance training for the Gaganyaan Human Mission has been put on hold due to lockdown due to global pandemic of COVID-19. The mission is expected to be launched in 2022 from India and is likely to carry these astronauts into low earth orbit in Space. “These pilots were expected to come back end of the year and get on with the module-specific training in India. All this has now been pushed back, as the Russia leg of the training will only finish next year,” explained a top officer who wished to remain anonymous.
“Russia’s Gagarin Research & Test Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) located at Star City, about 30km from Moscow has been regularly training crew for more than fifty years. Not only the Russian cosmonauts, but astronauts from various other countries, including the USA also go there for training,” Milind Kulshreshtha, C4I expert.
Crew training and Gaganyaan’s systems testing are two most critical activities listed for Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) this year. This was announced by the ISRO chairman K Sivan during a media interaction earlier this year.
ISRO’s Human Spaceflight Centre (HSFC) is involved in the mission planning, Systems Engineering for human survival in space, up to the stage of crew selection and training. In the Gaganyaan mission, the first of three flights was scheduled within a year, initial two flights to be unmanned but with humanoids onboard.
Even ISRO scientists are all working from home and through video conferencing. However, some scientists are out to work on projects following strict COVID-19 Social Distancing Protocols.
The R&D and manufacturing is not progressing and this is expected to have an impact on mission plans for the first Gaganyaan launch with a Humanoid.
Milind Kulshreshtha, C4I expert says, “The Russian Training Centre has tailor-made specialized equipment and gadgets to ensure specific mission-related training. This involves simulating the launch, space flight and reentry procedure, with such technology not yet developed in India.”
He highlights the space training facilities at the Centre in Russia, which includes:
This is to assist in astronavigation knowledge of the crew and for taking measurements using optical instruments. In this a planetarium facility recreating the sky as would be encountered by the crew has been created. This is to help the astronauts get used to this as they will see this during their scheduled flight and same as would be visible from the spacecraft window during the transit.
Short-term weightlessness training aboard aircraft to enhance crew skills and sense of orientation in weightlessness environment.
This is to attune space crew’s central nervous system to tolerate high gravitational effect experienced during the flight.
A full-scale spacecraft module has been recreated in a pool for crew practice working inside a spacecraft, wearing a heavy spacesuit. The model is immersible in water using hydraulic mechanism.
A simulated Main Control Console is used for training the pilots individually and for activities as a team.”
ISRO had planned launch of some major missions in next one year, with Gagaanyan-1 aimed by end of this year. Solar spacecraft Aditya and Chandrayaan-3 were also major missions scheduled by2021. The on-schedule launch of GISAT-1 onboard GSLV-F10 rocket on March 5, 2020 too got postponed just a day prior to launch due to ‘some’ technical reason, as announced by ISRO.
With the focus of the government on funding fight against COVID-19 pandemic, all strategic projects are likely to have budget restrictions. The Ministry of Defence has already announced hold on capital procurements at least for this quarter and future capital procurements too are under a shadow for now.
The likelihood that ISRO projects which are under strategic category too shall face a slowdown, not only due to pandemic restriction in work process flow but due to budget constraints in the future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zoom 5.0: Your video calls are now safe and secure</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The latest update to Zoom video conferencing app is now generally available. This release delivers one of Zoom’s most advanced security enhancements to date with support for AES 256-bit GCM encryption, which provides added protection for meeting data and greater resistance to tampering. What does this new encryption algorithm mean for you, and what other security functionality should users be aware of? Here are five things that answer your queries about Zoom 5.0:
AES 256-bit GCM encryptionZoom 5.0 supports the current encryption and GCM encryption. A system-wide account enablement to GCM encryption will occur on May 30, 2020, and only Zoom clients on version 5.0 or later, including Zoom Rooms, will be able to join Zoom Meetings starting May 30.
Report a User featureMeeting hosts and co-hosts can report a user in their meeting who is misusing the Zoom platform. Found in the Security icon, the option sends a report to Zoom’s Trust & Safety team for review.
New encryption iconA new encryption shield appears in the upper left of Zoom Meeting window and indicates a secure, encrypted meeting. After May 30, the shield will be green, denoting enhanced GCM encryption.
Enhanced data center information
Meeting hosts can now select data centre regions at the scheduling level for meetings and webinars. The Zoom client also shows which data centre you’re connected to in the Info icon.
Ending/leaving meetings
Zoom has refined the action of ending or leaving a Zoom Meeting to make it easier and more secure. With a new UI update, hosts can decide between ending or leaving. If the host leaves, they can select a new host and have the confidence that the right person is left with host privileges.
Additional security enhancements:
Profile picture control: Account admins and hosts can disable the ability for participants to show their profile picture and prevent changing it in a meeting.
Minimum password length: This will be six characters for meetings, webinars, and cloud recordings.
Cloud recording security: Admins and meeting hosts can set expirations on their cloud recordings and can disable the sharing of their recordings.
Updating to Zoom 5.0Zoom end users: Upgrade to Zoom 5.0 by visiting the Zoom download page.
Zoom administrators: Get detailed information on how to manage this update for various endpoints in your environment on the Zoom 5.0 IT administrators page.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SoftBank’s super-fast 5G network isn’t very useful just yet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SoftBank Corp.’s fifth-generation wireless service in Japan is living up to the hype in at least one respect — internet speeds that are blazingly fast even by the standards of one of the most connected countries in the world.
The carrier’s month-old 5G network topped out at 1.1 gigabits per second for downloads and about 30 megabits for uploads in tests carried out by Bloomberg News in Tokyo. Speeds of this kind, far surpassing typical wired broadband connections, have previously been possible only by pushing a fiber optic cable directly into a user’s home. But there are significant pieces still missing and preventing mass adoption: Coverage is severely limited for now, there’s little in the way of appealing content to capitalize on all that extra bandwidth and mobile data plans have yet to be revised to account for the much-increased consumption that 5G portends.
SoftBank and local rivals KDDI Corp. and NTT Docomo Inc. all launched their 5G offerings in late March in a handful of metropolitan areas around the country, while newcomer Rakuten Inc. has targeted June for launch. The Japanese telecommunication giants and their counterparts in South Korea and China have pressed ahead with deployment of next-generation networks despite global coronavirus woes. But 5G services touting high speeds and low latency are still out of reach for the majority of people eager for bandwidth to stream movies and telework as they shelter at home.
The coverage in Japan is still so thin that the three major carriers have all resorted to posting addresses of the exact locations where early adopters can get 5G bars. In Bloomberg’s own limited test of SoftBank’s network, the best reception was inside its store in Tokyo’s posh shopping district of Ginza, and the signal quickly dropped off to nothing about a block away. While SoftBank plans to expand the service to larger pockets of Tokyo and other big cities later this year, the company doesn’t expect to reach 90 percent of the population until March 2022 at the earliest.
Part of the challenge is that 5G networks have to be more dense than their predecessors. Their signals typically use higher-frequency spectrum, starting with 3.6 gigahertz in Japan, which allows for faster communication speeds at the expense of reach. Building out a 5G network at such frequency necessitates more networking infrastructure to achieve coverage. That’s more of an issue for sprawling places like the U.S. than densely populated Japan, said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Holdings who writes for Smartkarma.
“The coverage is still going to be spotty for a while,” said Boodry. “And since all of the operators upgraded to 5G at the same time, there is no advantage. The primary selling point is just speed.”
Even when it can be had, it’s not yet clear what that much bandwidth is actually good for. The handful of augmented and virtual reality experiences that come preinstalled on SoftBank’s 5G phones work just as well with a basic Wi-Fi connection. They lean heavily on teenage idols, letting users view performances by pop bands like AKB48 from multiple angles or in 3D. There’s also an app for streaming B. League basketball games, though all the matches have been canceled because of the virus outbreak. SoftBank is also launching a cloud gaming service in collaboration with Nvidia Corp.
The carrier, serving as the reliable revenue stream underpinning Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group Corp., is offering its 5G service as an add-on to existing plans for ¥1,000 per month. Subscribers who sign up by Aug. 31 will get it for free for two years. But all usage is counted toward the customer’s data cap, which could mean burning through the 50GB monthly allowance in mere minutes.
The operators are counting on the faster speeds nudging users to pay more for bigger data plans, but history suggests otherwise. SoftBank’s average revenue per user, ¥4,440 in the most recent quarter, has grown less than 10 percent since the company introduced the iPhone 3G more than a decade ago. 5G isn’t likely to bring much revenue upside either, Boodry said.
“Carriers have basically been trading capacity for revenue,” he said. “Operators thought that with 3G they could offer a lot of services and charge more, but there wasn’t all that much price elasticity.”
In 1993, at the dawn of mobile telephony, AT&T Inc. aired a series of TV commercials titled “You Will” that imagined future services like video calls, movie streaming and in-car navigation. Network operators have long been able to foresee, but not capitalize on, the major trends made possible by their technology. They have invested billions to build the infrastructure that made it possible for companies like Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to reap the benefits, earning the moniker of “dumb pipes” in the process.
Son is pulling out all the stops to avoid repeating that history. Last year he engineered a complex deal to combine SoftBank’s Yahoo Japan internet business with the country’s biggest messenger app Line Corp. The idea is to create a national champion capable of competing more effectively against global giants like Google and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Son has dubbed the strategy “beyond carrier.”
SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund has also bet big on the Japanese entrepreneur’s vision for a future centered on artificial intelligence and connected devices, investing in about 90 businesses ranging from ride sharing, coworking and robotics to agriculture, cancer detection and autonomous driving. SoftBank has also paid $32 billion for sole ownership of ARM Holdings PLC, a dominant supplier of semiconductor designs for mobile phones.
Son’s investments, whether they eventually pay off or not, reflect a prevailing technological zeitgeist that places increased importance on data. Recent breakthroughs in deep-learning algorithms, which vastly improved the ability of machines to perceive the world, have been fueled in part by large amounts of data generated by internet users. Examples include Google’s algorithmic Pixel smartphone cameras and smart voice assistants like Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa. 5G is likely to open the floodgates for a fresh torrent of data from real-world devices that range from tiny wearable sensors to autonomous vehicles.
“We don’t know what the really popular applications will be,” Boodry said. “It’s not just 5G, but also the shrinking cost of processing power. These trends are happening concurrently. Put them together and you have a lot of unpredictable synergies.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TL;DR: Get ready for your close up with this beauty ring light for $50.99, a 15% savings as of May 2. 
With everyone settling into their new stay-at-home routines, it's no longer a question of what you'll wear, but how to look presentable on Zoom. If you're working from home, you still want to appear put together in front of your colleagues. If you're dating from home, you still want to make sure you're looking cute and presentable.
Thankfully, video conferences don't require wearing pants (you should still wear them though), but if you do want to look your best, the least you can do is take a shower, wear an appropriate top, and secure great lighting. Sitting in front of a bright window is a rookie mistake. It will only cause the camera to underexpose and produce a dark silhouette.
Your best bet is to use something like the Beauty Ring Light with Mirror, which will give you the ample illumination you need to look fab in your subsequent virtual meetings and social engagements. This personal ring light has a built-in mirror and a tripod, so you don't have to worry too much about installation. It has ten brightness modes and three color adjustments — white light, natural light, and warm light  — all of which can easily be controlled via the included remote.
Check it out:
Of course, given that it's a beauty ring light, it can also help you apply makeup better. There's a two-sided mirror attached, which can be used normally or be magnified for extreme close-ups  —you know, when you're tweezing your brows or popping a zit. Everything's DIY these days so we can use all the help we can get.
Ready to look poppin' on your next video meeting? Get the Beauty Ring Light on sale for only $50.99 — 15% off the usual cost of $60.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Charge Running app is the perfect cure for those self-distancing blues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Work(out) From Homeis a weekly column where we review smart fitness machines and apps in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Thanks to technology, there are still plenty of ways to exercise if your gym is closed.
Easy to use • Motivational instructors • Variety of classes and levels • Tight-knit community of runners
Lack of playback controls for on-demand classes • No music app integration • Can't filter classes
The Charge Running app offers guided on-demand and live running sessions that are both effective and motivational. Its interactive chat feature also allows you to engage with an empowering, tight-knit community of runners.
I am the type of person who loves being on her own, especially when working out. It's an hour of my day where I get to completely zone out and just escape from all responsibilities. So, it's weird for me to admit that my workouts feel very lonely nowadays. But it's true.
I miss dodging people on my evening runs through the sidewalks of New York. I miss the crowded gym after work. I even miss feeling annoyed that all the treadmills are taken at said gym (even when I've managed to get there early).
So when I got an email about the Charge Running app, which offers both live and on-demand trainer-led running classes, I downloaded it immediately. Rather than strictly tracking data like distance, cadence, and pace, the app has remote trainers guiding you through each of your runs. 
The app is free to download on both iOS and the Google Play Store, and you get a two-week free trial. After that, it's $14.99 for a one-month subscription or $120.99 for an annual subscription.
Depending on your skill level and the class, Charge's trainers will talk you through each run based on energy exertion levels (which I'll get to later). That way, there's a lot more room to modify the experience based on your own metrics.
If you're unable to run outside due to the weather (or your personal preference), the classes can be easily adaptable to a treadmill. They're a great companion to have on your runs in general, especially during what feels like an endless period of social distancing. 
Whether you're joining in on a live run or opting for an on-demand class, each one does an excellent job of offering plenty of tips and direction, from trainers or the app's tight-knit community, that really help to motivate you. 
The Charge Running app offers a super simple user experience, so there's really not much of a learning curve.
Under the Browse tab is where you'll find all the live runs happening that day. You can scroll through to see the type of run, duration, trainer, and the time of day it starts. 
Since the app comes with iCal integration, those with iOS can add the run to their calendar and receive a notification before it starts. And, given the live runs are scheduled fairly far out in advance, it's easy to coordinate your workouts ahead of time. 
Additionally, the Browse section includes virtual events and runs — a lot of which are themed depending on the month. For May, you can choose between a Star Wars-themed run ("May the 4th be with you - 2 mile") or a Mother's Day race.
Below that are all the on-demand runs you can choose from. This section is a bit repetitive seeing as how there's a dedicated tab for it, as well. When you navigate to that tab, you can see all the different on-demand classes separated into programs including 5K training, 10K training, video content (which features warm-ups, stretches, and yoga), more virtual races, along with classes for moderate and hard runs. 
Tap on the Live tab to see which class is currently active along with the rest of the live sessions for that day. From here, you can also browse through the different days of the week at the top of the screen to see your future options and scheduled class times. 
If there's a specific trainer that you're interested in, the Trainers tab is where you can find an 'About Me' section along with their schedule for live runs. That way, you know when to look out for a particular trainer's next class if you want to join in. 
The last tab in the app is for your Profile. This is where you can view your stats, including total runs, total distance, and time spent on the app, along with your scheduled and completed runs. 
And while the app is super easy to use and navigate, I do wish there were a search filter that allowed you to easily pinpoint what it is you're looking for that day. It'd be nice to have the option to input my skill level, run duration, and preferred trainer so that the app can calculate and sort my options, instead of scrolling through classes that are mainly sorted via specific programs.
Another thing that's missing from the app is music integration. While the classes already come equipped with their own playlists, I'm very particular about my workout music. So, I would've liked to have the option to sync my own playlists while listening to the trainer guide me through the run. 
I'll start out by saying that you're going to want to join in on these live runs. Since it was a really busy week, I mainly took the on-demand classes and only managed to squeeze in one live session. 
At 40 minutes, that live class was a long one, so I really got the full Charge experience. And I loved it. Not only was it engaging, but it was also super easy to follow along. (Although, getting through the class wasn't as easy, but that's on me.)
When you start a live run, you'll see duration, your total distance, and average pace. Below that is a real-time updated leaderboard of everyone's names along with their current distance.
Charge Running uses your phone's GPS to track distance in real-time, but I noticed that it had a tendency to lag when updating your distance in the app. So, I'd recommend wearing a fitness tracker with built-in GPS, if you want to track it more intensely. 
As I mentioned before, Charge uses energy levels (based on a scale from 1 to 10) to help you gauge how much effort you should be putting in throughout each part of the run. 
A level one, for example, is a light jog during which you can still comfortably hold a conversation. A level two or three, however, ramps up the intensity, making it a little difficult to complete a spoken sentence or two.
Throughout the live Tempo run, the instructor had us going from a level one for about one to two minutes before building up to levels two and three (which you can choose between depending on how comfortable you're feeling) for about four minutes each. Then, she'd throw in a one-minute recovery run before gearing us back up to that level one routine. All of which is separated into different rounds.
Unlike Peloton, which attracts hundreds, if not thousands of people to each of its live classes, Charge's live runs are a lot smaller in number. The live moderate Tempo run I joined had about seven or eight people, which allowed the trainers to give everyone an equal amount of attention. With such a small class size, trainers are able to call out each runner, motivating them to keep going. 
Additionally, the trainers keep you informed of your distance and pace throughout each of the rounds and sometimes push you to lower your pace as the run progresses. It helps to keep you focused on just running, rather than constantly checking your metrics on your own to see your progress. Having someone keep track of all your stats in real-time is a game changer.
My favorite part of Charge Running, however, is the chat feature. During a live run, you can send texts to other runners in the group chat. While I was shy to join in on the conversation, I loved how positive everyone was for the entire 40 minutes of the run — whether it was sending messages of encouragement or just sharing details like the weather and how they were feeling.
There's also an option to just "listen-in" on the live runs, which is helpful on days when you can't run but still want to join in and help boost morale. 
On-demand classes are still just as effective, though. I've never run a 5K before, so I've been mainly sticking to that program of sessions. It's formatted the same way as live runs, but you don't have the live chat functionality or the trainer updating you on your stats.
You do, however, still have a leaderboard where you can participate against others who are also taking the class with you at the same time. And the trainers are still just as helpful and motivational throughout. 
The Charge Running app is certainly an excellent choice if you're looking for something to power you through your runs. It's not a revolutionary concept — apps like Couch to 5k, Peloton Digital, and Nike+ Run Club offer similar audio-guided runs. But Charge adds a human element that's missing from a lot of these types of apps. It really brings a different vibe to the overall experience that makes you feel like you're part of a community. And, seeing as how everyone is interacting with one another in real-time, you technically are.
I don't know about you, but that's something I think we all need while in lockdown. 
Additionally, for someone like me who's been very hesitant to join a running group in New York, it's a great introduction to what it might be like to actually go through with it. It allows me to build up the confidence to finally join one when all of this quarantining is over.
While Charge Running might be a pricey subscription investment for some, especially given the economic climate, it's definitely a worthy alternative to other, similar fitness apps. Runkeeper, Endomondo, and Studio, for example, are certainly cheaper, but none of them have the live trainer feature — and that's really what makes Charge worth the cost.
The community aspect on Charge, coupled with super calm and motivating trainers who are genuinely trying to help you get through those runs, helps foster an environment that's missing with a lot of these workout apps.
It's also been a great cure for that quarantine loneliness I mentioned before. Even though I'm technically running alone, Charge helps to make sure it doesn't actually feel like it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to be a better ally to women on Zoom</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Picture this: It's pre-pandemic and you're sitting in a work meeting. You've diligently prepared your notes and you're excited to present your ideas. Instead, you spend the entire meeting trying — and failing — to get a word in. 
Fast forward to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of staring at your coworkers from across a conference room table, you're at home speaking to them via video. But it's still the same story: When you attempt to talk, you're cut off multiple times. Each time this happens you smile awkwardly. The discussion continues and you wonder if anyone heard you.
Unfortunately, the new realities of working from home wrought by the coronavirus pandemic haven't yielded new, fairer standards for workplace etiquette. 
"It was a problem already in our old-school workplace paradigms: Women were being mansplained and over-talked," says Kim Churches, the CEO of the gender equity organization American Association of University Women (AAUW). 
For Sally McConnell-Ginet, professor emerita of linguistics at Cornell University, much of the issue stems from the ways in which we respond to and evaluate what women say and how they say it. In any setting, whether in-person or online, men and women can be doing the same thing but be judged differently because of the traditional power structures of our society. 
For example, a woman might be expected to be collaborative and only speak when called on. Or, a woman who speaks in the same manner as a man during a Zoom meeting could be interpreted as pushy by her colleagues but the man could be seen as having a great idea, explains McConnell-Ginet.
Churches, for her part, points to lags in internet connectivity, which can freeze the meeting and make it difficult to know what was said and who spoke last. This technological challenge can contribute to women being left out of the conversation, she explains. 
It's up to all of us in the meeting to make sure women's voices are heard because everyone loses out when sexism occurs, says Dr. Sarah J. Brazaitis, an associate professor in the department of organization and leadership at Columbia University's Teachers College. Brazaitis, who has a master's and PhD in counseling psychology, teaches students methods to help people feel more satisfied and perform better at work. After graduation, her students go on to get jobs teaching these processes to workplaces. Brazaitis focuses on the social forces that hold back employees due to their race and gender. She points to research that shows the best performing groups and teams are those where, by and large, the members of the team speak pretty equally.
In Churches' mind, when sexism shuts women up or judges them unfairly for their contributions to a meeting, we miss the diverse perspectives that are critical to a team's success. Women have viewpoints that men can't replicate, says Churches.
This advice is important now — but also for the future. It's likely these virtual forums won't be going away anytime soon, even when the pandemic ends as working from homewill likely be more common.
"We're all learning in real time that we can work elsewhere and still be strong colleagues and still deliver great product," says Churches. 
Here's how to be an ally to women in the workplace, even via a screen.
Whoever's leading the meeting has the most power in the room, and as such, should ensure women's voices are being heard, says Churches. 
One way to do so is by identifying the problem directly. Recently, Brazaitis led a meeting over Zoom for her master's and PhD students. The class has 27 students, with only five men. But when Brazaitis broke the class into groups to discuss the material and told each group to pick someone to report out the findings, every single one of the people presenting were men. 
After each group went, Brazaitis told her class that she was happy to hear their input, but she also wanted to hear from the women. Like Brazaitis, as a leader you can speak up when you see women's voices aren't being heard.  
McConnell-Ginet suggests similarly that leaders should ask women questions and have them elaborate on their thoughts. This can help open the door for women who may be interrupted frequently by their colleagues.
You can also encourage people to use video conferencing platforms' hand raising functions to prevent people from talking over one another, explains Churches. Zoom has this feature, as does Google Hangouts, and Microsoft Teams.
Churches also often makes note of the race and gender of the people she talks to, whether she's leading a meeting or talking to people outside AAUW, to ensure she taps into a diversity of voices. 
"We have a tendency as human beings to go with what we know," she says. By consciously tracking who she talks to she can ensure she fights against this bias. 
Leaders should also set meeting norms, says Brazaitis. For example, before the meeting you can say (and also establish formally via email), "We need to put norms in place because now we're all having these online meetings. Let's have standards that we won't interrupt one another and each person will have equal time to speak." You can also add that each person should manage their own speaking time, so it's clear that the responsibility is also on each team member to not over talk. 
There are ways for men to help, too. Speak up when you notice women in the workplace being interrupted or talked down to. You likely won't take flak for it because men tend to be expected to speak up in meetings without consequences (such as being viewed unfavorably by their coworkers), says Brazaitis. 
McConnell-Ginet agrees, explaining that when a man intervenes if a woman is being interrupted, his colleagues may view him as considerate because of gendered norms and expectations. On the other hand, if a woman does the same thing, she may be judged as overly pushy or a "whiny feminist." 
What's more, she believes people constantly put the responsibility on women to fix the problems they have in the workplace, such as suggesting they change how they say something. Instead, an ally can help repeat what a woman has said or ask for them to expand on their thoughts as this can help improve the chances that a woman can present her ideas, says McConnell-Ginet. 
But these comments have to be thoughtful, says Brazaitis. For example, she's heard well-intentioned men acknowledge that they're interrupting, apologize, but then say they want to allow their coworkers to speak. This kind of remark implies it's up to men to give women permission to speak. 
"It is her right [to speak] as a member of the team, not a special privilege being granted to her on behalf of her male colleague," says Brazaitis. 
Instead, you should note that you feel like you've been taking up too much air time and would really like to hear what others have to say, perhaps calling out other co-workers by name with a nod to a previous comment they made.  For example, you can say "Sarah, you had a great point about customer satisfaction earlier. Do you have more to say on that?" 
Churches, for her part, says that when men speak up in this way, even with a simple statement like, "Before we break, we didn't hear from Sarah, and I'd really like to see if she has additional thoughts," it shows they care about helping norms shift.
Even though it shouldn't be on women to make work meetings a supportive place, there's strength in numbers.
That's because there's power in women supporting their fellow women as they can face significant barriers in getting people to hear them, says McConnell-Ginet. A group approach can work better than a single woman pointing out she was disrupted during a meeting. After all, women are underrepresented atevery level within the workplace so banding together is especially important. 
For Brazaitis, it's more effective for other people to point out that a woman is being interrupted as the group will be more likely to view it as a legitimate problem and not something the woman caused.
While Brazaitis acknowledges this strategy can work against women, she thinks the benefits outweigh any potential negative outcomes.
"I don't think it is particularly problematic for women to speak up for other women...it might be that they get labeled trouble makers or 'they always stick up for each other' type of thing, but better to advocate in groups then solo regardless," says Brazaitis.
So if you notice a woman being ignored during your next work call, try to pluck up the courage to say something. Or, better yet, see if you can get other women to join in too. 
"A lot of times we're not the only woman on a Zoom call. So if we're afraid that we're not being heard, we also need to be upstanders and allies to our fellow women," says Churches.
If you see a woman being talked over, you can say "Hold on Tom, Tina was trying to say something and I think it would be important for us to hear her thoughts," suggests Churches.  
This kind of language can immediately stop the interruption in its tracks instead of allowing it to carry on. 
While it's not up to women to make online interactions a welcoming space for themselves, there are some things they can do to boost their chances of being heard during online meetings, says Brazaitis.
First, women can prepare. This doesn't just mean you have new ideas to share and are ready to update everyone on your work progress (though, you should be doing that too). You should also be thinking about how you'll present yourself during the meeting. 
Lighting is important. Make sure you're not backlit so you can be visible to other participants, suggests Churches. If you're already being talked over, you don't also want to be physically invisible on the call. 
You should also anticipate problems with internet connectivity. When online meetings suffer from internet lags, someone may accidentally talk over a woman because of the bad connection. Our instinct may be to stop talking but Churches says it's better to finish your thought so you can get the entire idea out. 
These setbacks are more likely to crop up as virtual meetings become more socially accepted and routine, so it's even more urgent that everyone makes sure women’s skills, ideas, and contributions are well represented, says Churches. 
"Women make up half of the labor force...Our ideas, thoughts, analysis, and expertise are valued and this is, frankly, about economic security and moving forward in an unprecedented time," says Churches. "We should care about this because if we're going to continue to be a productive nation, we need to do everything we can to remove the barriers, bias, and discrimination holding women back in every venue, including now in video conferencing."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The complete guide to cleaning your headphones during a pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Going outside without music or podcasts to listen to can be a drag. During the coronavirus pandemic, however, you might consider taking some extra precautions so you can jam out safely during your grocery runs.
The CDC recommends properly cleaning personal electronics as necessary. While headphones and earbuds aren't specifically named in its guidelines, you probably touch them enough to warrant proper disinfection just to be safe. The good news is there are fairly easy ways to do this.
We've taught you how to clean your phone, laptop, and even video game controllers. Here's how to clean your headphones.
One of the more harrowing aspects of COVID-19 is that we don't yet know everything we need to know about it. That said, we can still use what information we have to understand the risks of going out in public with headphones right now.
In a phone call with Mashable, infectious disease physician Dr. Anne Liu of Stanford Health Care cleared up some concerns you may have about headphone use during the pandemic. First things first: While there isn't an abundance of data on the subject, it's not widely believed that COVID-19 can be transmitted through your ears. Liu explained that the ears don't connect to respiratory epithelial cells, which the American Lung Association describes as material that catch viruses in the body's airways.
“It is not transmitted through the skin," Liu said. "And your ears are covered in skin, there’s no direct passage into your respiratory epithelium.”
Though the virus isn't known to be transmissible through ears, using your headphones without taking safety measures still has some risk associated with it, even if the risk isn't major. The coronavirus can live on hard surfaces like plastic, glass, and wood for three to five days, per the Cleveland Clinic. If the virus does find its way onto a pair of headphones, you could conceivably catch it by touching them and then touching your face without washing your hands first.
Still, according to Liu, the risk of catching the coronavirus from headphone use isn't especially high, depending on the circumstances.
“If you’re outdoors and people are respecting social distancing, then the risk is very low," Liu said. "A more likely situation for [COVID-19] transmission is when people are not physically distancing, especially in enclosed spaces, but it could also be outdoors when people are packed together enough for a long enough period of time.”
Dr. Mia Lieberman, a clinical veterinarian at Harvard Medical School, once conducted a study on smartphone sterilization. She explained that different devices have different risk factors. Since headphones and earbuds aren't touched quite as often as a phone (which also touches your face during calls), they don't necessarily carry the same amount of risk.
"Earbuds, you kind of put in, listen to music, and take out again. It's not as high of a contact surface compared to your phone, which you're handling all the time," Lieberman said.
In terms of the best products to use for disinfecting headphones, Lieberman warned that different materials require different methods. Rigid surfaces like plastic may be able to withstand rubbing alcohol or disinfecting wipes, but Lieberman recommended headphone users find out what the product's maker recommends for material like fabric.
"Probably an alcohol wipe wouldn't do too much damage, but there's obviously a variety of different materials out there so people should consult the manufacturer," Lieberman said.
As for how often to wash headphones, Liu told us it depends on the environment. Those in densely packed urban areas should probably at least wipe things off when they get home but, otherwise, it varies.
“If you go for a jog outside and ... you don’t really encounter a lot of people, I wouldn’t really worry about it," Liu said. "Unless you’ve been handling shared objects or shared surfaces with your hands, in which case it’s probably a good idea to do it.”
Now, onto the cleaning process. We'll echo Dr. Lieberman's advice up front and tell you to Google cleaning instructions for the specific headphones you use. Chances are the company itself has those on its website. Apple and Bose, for example, will tell you what to do and what not to do as you try to clean your headphones.
Earbuds are the smallest and most delicate of headphones, so it should go without saying that you need to be careful while disinfecting them. Before you do anything, make sure they're powered off (if Bluetooth) or unplugged (if not). After that, you need to clean the rubber tips (if any), plastic casing, and the mesh speaker grill separately, using different materials and methods.
Removable ear tips need to be, well, removed before you attack the waxy buildup on them. Clear out the worst of the wax first, using anything you have on hand that might be useful, a toothpick or paper clip. Now that they're ready to be really cleaned, Bose and Beats both recommend mild soap and water, preferably with a soft cloth on hand for drying. Be gentle.
For the plastic exterior, a soft cloth or cotton swab will work wonders here, too. Apple doesn't want you using soap, bleach, or other cleaning solutions of any kind on AirPods, but 70 percent isopropyl rubbing alcohol is apparently fine. Alcohol or Clorox wipes are probably the easiest way to clean off the plastic part of any earbuds. Just don't go overboard if you don't want to scuff up the material in any way.
Finally, the speaker grill is where you need to be the most delicate. Soap stains on plastic are one thing, but a speaker that doesn't work because you cleaned it wrong is cataclysmic in terms of your listening ability. It's worth reiterating that you should not, under any circumstances, let liquid get into the grill. A tooth brush or cotton swab (with a light amount of rubbing alcohol) can get the residue off the grill without risking its life. Take care not to push anything into the grill.
For clarity's sake, this section pertains to bigger headphones that rest on your head with a headband. On-ear headphones have smaller ear cups that rest on the ear, while over-ear headphones are bigger and their ear cups surround the ear. If you're tired of dealing with earwax, the good news is cleaning on-ear or over-ear headphones is a little more straightforward.
As usual, try to use liquid only on harder, more durable surfaces. Bose and Beats both suggest using a damp cloth with soap to clean places like the headband and other exterior surfaces. Rubbing alcohol could also work here. Keep softer areas on the headphones dry. Bose says to use a dry cloth on the ear cushions after prolonged use to clear them of oils and such that build up over time.
If your beefy headphones have removable ear cups, it's probably best to take them off and clean them separately. As always, be sure not to let liquids get into the nooks and crannies. They may be bigger, but they can still die just like earbuds can. If you see any gunk that needs to be removed, do so much like you'd remove earwax from earbuds. 
The truth is it's probably smart to do all of these things periodically when we aren't dealing with a pandemic. Even so, the coronavirus has made it abundantly clear just how dirty our electronics can get, and the risk associated with touching them without taking any precautions. 
So grab those Clorox wipes and get to work.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo commercial space plane has officially made its first successful test flight out of Spaceport America, its base in New Mexico.
On Friday, the company announced that its suborbital spacecraft, called VSS Unity, marked "an important flight test milestone in preparation for commercial service."
Though Unity had already completed several successful glide tests — including milestone flights in December 2018 and February 2019 — this was the first successful free flight in the New Mexico airspace.
According to the online statement, "The milestone flight took off from the Spaceport America runway, with VSS Unity attached to the carrier aircraft, VMS Eve." The company went on to explain that all vehicles rose to an altitude of 50,000 feet before Unity was released.
"The spaceship achieved a glide speed of Mach 0.70 and completed multiple test-points, before touching back down smoothly for a runway landing at Spaceport America," Virgin Galactic said.
"This glide flight provided the first opportunity to test all the components required to fly the carrier aircraft and spaceship in glide configuration, from a new home base and in new airspace," the company's statement reads. "The flight test also provided an opportunity for the pilots and spaceflight operations team to continue familiarisation with the new airspace around the Gateway to Space and a chance to capture valuable in-flight data and conduct further pilot training."
The eventual goal is to be able to use the spacecraft to carry six passengers in commercial operations, so the fact that this test run was successful is another step closer to achieving that objective.
"Today's VSS Unity flight is another exciting milestone for Virgin Galactic’s progress in New Mexico," Dan Hicks, Executive Director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority said in the announcement.
He remarked that the successful flight was especially noteworthy because it also took place in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.
"We are extremely happy and proud of Virgin Galactic, not only for today's success but also for the exceptional way they have integrated into NM and supported the region and State during this stressful time dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic," Hicks continued. "Spaceport America and Virgin Galactic have adhered to new guidelines set by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to include social distancing and wearing masks. A big thank you to our foundational partner at Spaceport America!"
Per the online statement, preparation for SpaceShipTwo Unity's next flight is now underway.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TL;DR: A one-year subscription to Private Internet Access VPN is on sale for $2.85 per month as of May 3, saving you 71% on list price.
There are a lot of VPN providers out there to consider, and some will try to lure you in with seriously slick sites and interfaces. This sort of thing isn't really important though, and you should always focus on performance and features.
Private Internet Access is not the best-looking VPN. The site is a little all over the place, and the interface is dated. Don't let this put you off though, because PIA leads the way when it comes to security and accessibility.
Private Internet Access provides state-of-the-art, multi-layered security with advanced privacy protection using VPN tunneling. Its services have been designed from the ground up to be able to operate using pre-existing tech in your computer or smartphone, so you can relax.
A one-year subscription to Private Internet Access is now on sale for $2.85 per month, and includes an extra two months of protection for free. This plan is down by 71% on list price, and includes a generous 30-day money-back guarantee.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple CEO Tim Cook challenged graduates to see beyond how coronavirus may have scuttled their plans in a virtual address to Ohio State University.
Their post-college dreams may be delayed, but most have not seen the worst of COVID-19.
"Those of us who can look back on this time and remember inconveniences and even boredom can count themselves lucky. Many more will know real hardship and fear. Others still will be cut to the bone," he said in a recording released on YouTube Sunday. 
"While we turn to our loved ones and friends for comfort, think hard about those whose impact on your life is more distant but no less meaningful," he added. "Think about an undocumented father, ignored or scorned by his community, who is putting himself at risk in the fields today to feed his family and yours. Think about a single mother who stocks shelves at night and drives a city bus in the morning, without whom so much would fall apart. Think about the hospital orderly scrubbing down the ward on hands and knees, whose work today is as solitary and sacred as a high priest purifying a temple."
And beyond all that, he asked, "think about how you, blessed with a world-class education, might act and work and be differently when all this is said and done."

    <h5 class="mb-1">App icons promoting wearing facemask amid COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Internet companies like Urban Company, MakeMyTrip, Dunzo, HealthifyMe and Zomato are changing their social media handles and app icons to promote wearing face masks as a hygiene practice amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Apna Mask initiative -- an effort by StartUpVsCOVID (a startup community with over 1,000 members) -- is promoting homemade masks and aims to drive behavioural change to ensure that people wear masks and stay protected as they step out of their homes.
The #ApnaDeshApnaMask campaign was kicked off by startup industry stalwarts like Rajan Anandan of Sequoia India, Paytm's Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Alok Mittal (Indifi), Vishal Gondal (GoQii) and others. They were later joined by celebrities like Vidya Balan, Dia Mirza, Juhi Chawla, Divya Khosla Kumar, Juhi Parmar, Deepshika Deshmukh, Sonu Sood, Shama Sikander, Preetika Rao and others.
Within a span of two weeks, the initiative has garnered 100 million outreach across digital platforms, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
The team working on the campaign also reached out to various organisations to support the initiative, especially as parts of the country get ready to come out of the lockdown which has been extended till May 17.
"Urban Company, MakemyTrip, Dunzo, HealthifyMe, Zomato, Redbus, Ixigo, MoneyTap, MyUpchaar, Bounce, RazorPay, Medanta, WittyFeed, LBB, Porter, Meesho, Daily Hunt, 1mg, Paytm Games have changed their social media handles while some are changing the app icons as well," a statement said.
These brands are also inviting more companies to join the initiative.
"Given the immense response we have received, we will have more brands join #ApnaMask in this critical initiative. We believe some of these steps will be helpful in building habit changing behaviour towards wearing homemade masks," Poonam Kaul, co-founder of ApnaMask, said.
In a separate statement, Crowdera -- an online fundraising platform -- said it is offering its premium syndicated fundraising technology solutions for free to companies and NGOs working to help the COVID-19 affected individuals, families and health workers.
"Crowdera will be extending its support through offering its products and services worth almost USD 150,000 (Rs 1 crore) free to organisations aiding the affected...The solution will help corporations and NGOs to quickly syndicate with their own employees, influencers, other foundations, or charity partners to raise funds 10X more than through a regular crowdfunding campaign," it said.  
Under this pledge, Crowdera has already extended its support to companies like Rapido, Repos, BYJU'S, SirfTaxi, and Tartl to engage their employees and partners in fundraising for the COVID-affected workforce.

This the daily Covid update from Deccan Herald. 
On the bulletin today: Karnataka reports 13 new cases… CRPF and BSF battalions report Covid-19 cases...Karnataka makes plans to resume work from tomorrow...And Amulya brings us a round up of pandemic from across the world, with a focus on AfricaBut first, a look at the national numbers.
At the time of this recording...more than 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today.Nearly 29,000  people are active carriers of the virus.More than 11,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,391 covid-related deaths so far.Nearly 42,000 cases have been reported from across India till date.----The Indian Council of Medical Research has tested more than 10 lakh  or 1 million samples from across the country since the first case was reported.As a comparison, New York has tested just under a million samples so far and the USA has tested more than 6.8 million samples.----A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 678 new cases today and Mumbai alone recorded 21 deaths. The state has more than ten thousand active cases.Gujarat reported 374 cases and has more than 4000 active cases. Punjab added 330 new cases and is fast approaching a 1000 active cases. Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan recorded 158 and 112 new cases each. Among the southern states, Tamil Nadu added 266 new cases and has over 1600 active cases.----The state has reported 13 new cases today. So far 614 positive cases have been reported, out of which 295 cases are still active. 3 patients are in the ICU and 293 patients have been discharged so far. There have been 25 deaths in the state till date.---Kalaburagi has reported 6 cases today, of whom 2 are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. 1 patient has presented with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness. 2 have presented with Influenza Like Illness and their contacts are under investigation. Contacts are under investigation for the last of the six.Bengaluru Urban reported 4 cases, of which one patient is from the containment ward in Padarayanapura. Three others are contacts of a previously diagnosed patient.3 cases have come in Bagalkote, of which 2 in Mudhol are contacts of a previously diagnosed patient and 1 in Badami has presented with SARI, and this case is being investigated.---According to Davanagere Deputy Commissioner Mahantesha Beelagi, 21 cases and 1 death have been reported from the district. We are awaiting confirmation from the state health department regarding these cases.---Moving on to the news from across the country, with close to 521 deaths and 10,000 positive cases,  Mumbai Metropolitan Region contributes to the maximum cases of Covid-19 in the country. The MMR comprises three districts of Mumbai City,  Mumbai Suburban and Thane, and also parts of  Palghar and Raigad districts and constitutes around 2% of India’s geographical area. It is also one of the most densely populated regions in the country which sees a high movement of people. Dharavi, has itself registered more than 500 cases.---In Delhi, CRPF and BSF forces have been hit by the Covid-19 scare. 40 officers and staff at the CRPF headquarters, including a Special Director General have been home quarantined after a driver tested positive. The headquarters will remain closed until Tuesday morning.More than 100 CRPF personnel from various battalions have tested positive in other parts of Delhi.Besides CRPF, the Border Security Force has also been affected, with atleast 42 personnel testing positive across the country.---Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex , one of the largest vegetable, fruit and flower markets in the country spread across nearly 300 acres, is emerging as the newest hotspot for Covid-19 infections in Tamil Nadu. More than 100 people, including vendors, labourers and buyers, who went to the market complex, spread across several districts have tested positive for Covid-19. While 60 of the 100 are from Chennai alone, the remaining are from Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Villupuram, Ariyalur, Perambur, and Cuddalore districts.---In news from Karnataka,The third leg of the lockdown kicks in tomorrow, and the revised guidelines will govern life in the various zones. According to a notification from the Chief Secretary, Karnataka - Bengaluru Urban, Rural and Mysuru are in the Red Zone.13 districts in the state have made it to the Orange zone including Kalaburagi.And 14 districts including Davangere are in the green zone. ---In another circular, the Chief Secretary has said that Bengaluru Rural, Bengaluru Urban, Ramanagara, Chikkaballapura and Kolar districts will be treated as a single unit for the purpose of vehicular movement between 7am and 7pm. Movement between these districts is allowed for permitted activities, as long as individuals have a letter from the organisation they are working in.
All other districts require an inter-district movement pass, and these will be issued by respective DCs and DCPs. Passes will only be issued for permitted activities. For those stranded away from home, a one-time pass will be issued.Essential services that have already been provided with passes, will continue to be valid during the night time curfew between 7pm to 7 am.The IT and BT sector will be issued curfew passes by their respective DCPs.---According to a circular issued by the Chief Secretary, a 100% turn out is expected from all categories of staff from departments identified as essential services from May 4th. The departments are Health and Family Welfare, Medical Education, Home, Revenue, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Urban Development, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Information and Public Relations, Transport, Energy, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Finance (including treasuries), Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, Forest, Ecology and Environment, APMC markets, Agriculture, Labour and Horticulture.This circular also applies to all the Red Zones in Karnataka.
For other departments, all officers under Group A and B, along with 33% staff from Group C and D, are expected to resume work in the Red Zone areas from tomorrow.
All categories of staff from all the departments will be back at work in the Orange and Green zones starting tomorrow.
---Following criticism to charge labourers three times the normal bus fare to go home, the Karnataka government announced free travel arrangements for labourers for the next three days.KSRTC buses will not charge any fare to the labourers wanting to return to their native districts in the state.---Moving on, in our international segment, Amulya takes a look at Africa, a continent that seems to have slipped from everyone’s memory, and its response to the pandemic.
As of this weekend, the number of people infected with the coronavirus may have crossed the 3-milion mark globally, but the good news is that the number of recoveries from the virus has crossed 1 million. 
Singapore is recovering from its second wave of infections and New Zealand has downgraded the threat level which has led to the loosening of the lockdown. In Europe, the  schools are opening despite some concerns about the spread of the virus. 
However, there is very little talk about what is happening in the huge continent of Africa, where it was predicted early on that the novel coronavirus might be especially devastating, given the challenges regarding hospital infrastructure and the poorly-trained staff. Since the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Egypt in February, Africa’s number of cases has soared to 40,000 and the number of deaths stand at 1600 as of this weekend. As per the Africa’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the northern part of the continent leads in the number of infections as well as the deaths, with Egypt, Morocco and Algeria in the lead. These four countries account for more than half of the cases in the continent. The chances of a major outbreak in other countries is a realistic fear, right now. 
In Somalia, in west Africa, Guardian reports that medics, funeral workers and gravediggers have reported an unprecedented surge of deaths in recent days, giving credence to the view that the official counts of Covid-19 deaths reflect only a fraction of the virus’s toll in Africa. 
Many countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya have imposed STRINGENT lockdowns and curfews, which is not entirely new to the continent, which has seen its share of state violence.In Kenya, President Uhuru Kenyatta even apologised for overzealous policing.
On May 1st, South Africa relaxed its lockdown with President Cyril Ramaphosa remarking “Our people need to eat”. The country is in recession and the president is trying to strike a balance between the public health and national economy. For the latter, he even announced an $26.9bn economic stimulus and social relief package, amounting to about 10 percent of the nation’s GDP. 
With the spread of the virus flattening elsewhere, Africa could be the next coronavirus hotspot. The continent has previous experience of handling HIV and Ebola outbreaks, which it has used successfully by coming up some local inventions like the 1$ coronavirus test kits, developed by a laboratory in Senegal. Let’s hope this experience will lead to many such inventions. ---And before we go, if you’ve been worried about a flu but you’re not quite sure if it’s Covid-19 - here’s a service that will send help your way. Call Aptha-mitra at 14410, a medical helpline by the Karnataka government that will help you understand what to do next!---For the latest updates, log on to deccanerald.com.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Amid international concern about close ties between Chinese technology groups like Huawei Technologies and the communist government, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corporation is facing accusations it has been recording millions of users’ private data and browsing habits in a more invasive manner than its competitors.
According to a report by Forbes Magazine, a cybersecurity expert found that a large amount of his data and online behavior using a Redmi Note 8 smartphone were being harvested, tracked, and sent to a remote server, while connections could be made between the individual user and the data collected.
Even when the expert, Gabi Cirlig, switched his phone to the private “incognito” mode, the phone was still recording his searches and the websites he visited. The information ended up on remote servers in Singapore and Russia with Web domains registered in China, Forbes reported.
Xiaomi denied there was a privacy problem, though Cirlig found similar browser code on other devices from the company, suggesting they would have the same issues. He warned that data sent to the tech group’s servers could easily be linked to specific users, as unique numbers identifying each device were also being collected.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What happens when you stack kindling and logs in a fireplace and then drop some matches is that you typically start a …
Surely a system smart enough to contribute to The New Yorker would have no trouble completing the sentence with the obvious word, fire. GPT-2 responded with ick. In another attempt, it suggested that dropping matches on logs in a fireplace would start an “irc channel full of people.”
Marcus wasn’t surprised. Commonsense reasoning—the ability to make mundane inferences using basic knowledge about the world, like the fact that “matches” plus “logs” usually equals “fire”—has resisted AI researchers’ efforts for decades. Marcus posted the exchanges to his Twitter account with his own added commentary: “LMAO,” internet slang for a derisive chortle. Neural networks might be impressive linguistic mimics, but they clearly lack basic common sense.
Minutes later, Yejin Choi saw Marcus’s snarky tweet. The timing was awkward. Within the hour, Choi was scheduled to give a talk at a prominent AI conference on her latest research project: a system, nicknamed COMET, that was designed to use an earlier version of GPT-2 to perform commonsense reasoning.
Quickly, Choi—a senior research manager at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, who describes herself as an “adventurer at heart”—fed COMET the same prompt Marcus had used (with its wording slightly modified to match COMET’s input format):
Gary stacks kindling and logs and drops some matches.
COMET generated 10 inferences about why Gary might be dropping the matches. Not all of the responses made sense, but the first two did: He “wanted to start a fire” or “to make a fire.” Choi tweeted the results in reply to Marcus and strode up to the podium to include them in her presentation. “It seemed only appropriate,” she said.
Common sense has been called the “dark matter of AI”—both essential and frustratingly elusive. That’s because common sense consists of implicit information—the broad (and broadly shared) set of unwritten assumptions and rules of thumb that humans automatically use to make sense of the world. For example, consider the following scenario:
A man went to a restaurant. He ordered a steak. He left a big tip.
If you were asked what he ate, the answer—steak—comes effortlessly. But nowhere in that little scene is it ever stated that the man actually ate anything. When Ray Mooney, the director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, pointed this out after giving me the same pop quiz, I didn’t believe him at first. “People don’t even realize that they’re doing this,” he said. Common sense lets us read between the lines; we don’t need to be explicitly told that food is typically eaten in restaurants after people order and before they leave a tip.
Computers do. It’s no wonder that commonsense reasoning emerged as a primary concern of AI research in 1958 (in a paper titled “Programs With Common Sense”), not long after the field of AI was born. “In general, you can’t do natural-language understanding or vision or planning without it,” said Ernest Davis, a computer scientist at New York University who has studied common sense in AI since the 1980s.
Still, progress has been infamously slow. At first, researchers tried to translate common sense into the language of computers: logic. They surmised that if all the unwritten rules of human common sense could be written down, computers should be able to use them to reason with in the same way that they do arithmetic. This symbolic approach, which came to be known as “good old-fashioned artificial intelligence” (or GOFAI), enabled some early successes, but its handcrafted approach didn’t scale. “The amount of knowledge which can be conveniently represented in the formalisms of logic is kind of limited in principle,” said Michael Witbrock, an AI researcher at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. “It turned out to be a truly overwhelming task.”
Deep learning with neural networks seemed to offer an alternative. These AI systems, designed to mimic the interconnected layers of neurons in biological brains, learn patterns without requiring programmers to specify them in advance. Over the past decade, increasingly sophisticated neural networks, trained with copious amounts of data, have revolutionized computer vision and natural-language processing. But for all their flexibility and apparent intellectual power—neural networks can now steer cars in highway traffic and beat world-class players at chess and Go—these systems remain notorious for their own silly (and occasionally fatal) lapses in ordinary common sense. “Acquiring it, representing it, reasoning with it—it’s all hard,” Davis said.
Now Choi and her collaborators have united these approaches. COMET (short for “commonsense transformers”) extends GOFAI-style symbolic reasoning with the latest advances in neural language modeling—a kind of deep learning that aims to imbue computers with a statistical “understanding” of written language. COMET works by reimagining commonsense reasoning as a process of generating plausible (if imperfect) responses to novel input, rather than making airtight deductions by consulting a vast encyclopedia-like database.
“It tries to blend two very fundamentally different approaches to AI,” said Mooney, who is already using COMET in his own research. “It’s an interesting new direction that says, ‘Hey, there’s a middle road there.’” Leora Morgenstern, an expert in commonsense reasoning and AI at the Palo Alto Research Center who has spent decades researching symbolic approaches to the problem, thinks that the ideas behind COMET can help move the field forward. “One of the reasons I’m so excited about what Yejin is doing is I think it will inject new life into the commonsense-reasoning community,” she said. “Deep learning is really, really powerful—let’s figure out how to harness it for common sense.”
Common sense is easier to detect than to define. According to Witbrock, the phrase common sense can mean both a kind of knowledge and an attitude toward that knowledge. “I would say [it’s] broadly reusable background knowledge that’s not specific to a particular subject area,” he said. “It’s knowledge that you ought to have.” Like, for example, the fact that people eat food in restaurants, rather than just ordering and paying for it, or that dropping matches on a pile of stacked logs implies that one is trying to light a fire.
The implicit nature of most commonsense knowledge makes it difficult and tedious to represent explicitly. “What you learn when you’re 2 or 4 years old, you don’t really ever put down in a book,” said Morgenstern. Nevertheless, early AI researchers believed that bridging this gap was possible. “It was like, ‘Let’s write down all the facts about the world. Surely there’s only a couple million of them,’” said Ellie Pavlick, a computer scientist at Brown University. Constructing such a resource, known as a knowledge base, has traditionally been the first step in any approach to automating commonsense reasoning.
Building up a sufficient number of obvious facts is harder than it sounds. A commonsense-reasoning project called Cyc began in 1984 with the modest-sounding goal of encoding the implicit commonsense knowledge necessary to represent 400 encyclopedia articles. It never stopped. More than three decades later, Cyc’s knowledge base—encoded in a dense, custom-designed logical notation—contains “millions of collections and concepts, and more than 25 million assertions.” Yet a 2015 review article by Davis and Marcus stated that “Cyc has had comparatively little impact on AI research.” Subsequent attempts to write entries for a knowledge base—or to create one by mining documents using machine learning—have failed to crack the commonsense-reasoning problem.
Why? For one thing, “there’s always exceptions to every case,” Pavlick explained. “If I hear some statement like ‘It’s raining,’ I could infer that if I go outside, I’ll get wet, but not if [I’m] underneath something.” Other exceptions are harder to anticipate. A knowledge base like Cyc may contain dozens of statements about what typically happens when a person orders food in a restaurant. But what about the potentially endless list of infrequent or unusual things that could happen in that scenario, like leaving without paying the check, or starting a food fight? “Coverage is never-ending,” said Choi. “Therefore, purely symbolic knowledge-based approaches are entirely doomed.”
Even if it were possible to build a knowledge base 100 or 1,000 times as comprehensive as any previous attempt, the system would still suffer from another intellectual shortcoming: the so-called brittleness problem. That’s because common sense, like natural language, remains fundamentally fuzzy. When a server asks a diner, “Are you still working on that?” we understand them to mean “Are you still eating what’s on your plate?” But if the server asks the same question to a line cook preparing an overdue order, it means something else entirely. So is a restaurant a place where people “work” on things? Are “eating” and “working” distinct concepts?
It all depends. That’s the brittleness problem: Sharply defined relations within a knowledge base may enable powerful, reliable reasoning abilities, as long as those conceptual edges are respected. But these symbolic systems, no matter how varied and rich, inevitably fail to capture the natural ambiguities and associative overlaps that often occur in human commonsense reasoning. “To the extent that we [use] symbols,” Pavlick said, “we’re quite fluid with them.”
Choi didn’t start working on common sense because she wanted to tilt at windmills. When she joined the Allen Institute in 2018, she “had a hunch” that neural networks could enable new progress where knowledge bases had stalled on their own. She just didn’t know exactly how. She didn’t want to write off previous symbolic approaches completely either. “All the past research was based on a lack of data,” she said, or a lack of computing resources. “So I figured I’d just withhold my judgment until I properly tried different routes.”
With an open mind, Choi and her colleagues began to assemble their own knowledge base, called Atomic (short for “atlas of machine commonsense”). “Basically, I wanted to write a textbook for neural networks to learn faster about the world,” Choi said. “Then things happened simultaneously—as we had this knowledge [base] built, GPT-2 came out.”
That neural network, released in February 2019, was just one in a wave of “pretrained language models” that began to revolutionize how computers process natural language. These systems don’t contain neatly organized linguistic symbols or rules. Instead, they statistically smear their representations of language across millions or billions of parameters within a neural network. This property makes such systems difficult to interpret, but it also makes them robust: They can generate predictions based on noisy or ambiguous input without breaking. When fine-tuned to perform a specific task—like answering written questions or paraphrasing text—language models even appear to understand at least some of what they’re reading.
Choi now saw a way to put her hunch about neural networks and common sense into action.
What would happen if a language model were given additional training using a commonsense-knowledge base, like Atomic? Could the neural network learn to fill in Atomic’s gaps with plausible commonsense inferences all on its own, just as GPT-2 learned how to automatically generate plausible news articles? “It’s almost weird that nobody tried this before,” Choi said. “It’s almost as if nobody bothered, because they were so sure this would never work.”
When Choi (and her collaborators Antoine Bosselut, Hannah Rashkin, Maarten Sap, Chaitanya Malaviya, and Asli Celikyilmaz) fine-tuned a neural language model with the commonsense knowledge encoded in Atomic, they created COMET. Its fusion of symbolic reasoning with a neural network tries to solve the coverage and brittleness problems at the same time. Anyone can type a prompt into COMET in everyday language. If the event is already represented in the system’s commonsense-knowledge base (like the fact that ordering food in a restaurant usually involves eating it), COMET can simply reason with that preexisting information. For everything else, the neural language model makes its best guess.
Those guesses are surprisingly good. On average, 77.5 percent of the novel responses generated by COMET—that is, inferences that come from the neural network, rather than from the preexisting knowledge base—were deemed “plausible” by teams of human evaluators. That’s less than 10 percentage points shy of human-level performance. (Evaluators found 86 percent of knowledge-base entries written by humans to be plausible.) When COMET was given the prompt “PersonX gives PersonY some pills,” it guessed that PersonX wanted to help; when it was told that “PersonX murders PersonY’s wife,” COMET suggested that PersonX wanted to hide the body.
These examples showed how COMET could handle input beyond the limits of its built-in commonsense “coverage.” But what about the brittleness problem? While interviewing Choi late last year at her lab in Seattle, I gave COMET a prompt phrased in my 5-year-old daughter’s patois: “Daddy goed to work.”
Choi frowned. “That may be tricky,” she said. But COMET took it in stride, suggesting that “Daddy” wanted to “make money,” “do their job,” and “get a paycheck”; that he is seen as “hardworking,” “motivated,” and “dutiful”; and that as a result, others feel “proud,” “grateful,” and—in an amusingly plausible response, given that the request was written in kindergartner-speak—“annoyed.” (My daughter has certainly expressed that sentiment when I leave for work instead of playing with her.) “This wouldn’t work with Cyc, for sure,” Choi remarked. “Unless someone hand-codes that goed means ‘went’—which we never did.”
There’s a quip Gary Marcus likes to use to put progress in AI into context: “Just because you can build a better ladder doesn’t mean you can build a ladder to the moon.” To him and others, COMET’s approach suffers from a fundamental limitation of deep learning: “statistics ≠ understanding.” “You can see that [COMET] does a decent job of guessing some of the parameters of what a sentence might entail, but it doesn’t do so in a consistent way,” Marcus wrote via email. Just as no ladder, no matter how tall, can ever hope to reach the moon, no neural network—no matter how deft at mimicking language patterns—ever really “knows” that dropping lit matches on logs will typically start a fire.
Choi, surprisingly, agrees. She acknowledged that COMET “relies on surface patterns” in its training data, rather than actual understanding of concepts, to generate its responses. “But the fact that it’s really good at surface patterns is a good thing,” she said. “It’s just that we’ve got to supply it with more informative surface patterns.”
What might those more informative patterns look like? Some researchers argue that in order to build real common sense into computers, we will need to make use of phenomena outside language itself, like visual perceptions or embodied sensations. These more direct first-person representations may be the foundation of common sense, with language acting as a secondary layer.
“If I lived in a world where there were no other people [to talk to], I could still have common sense—I’d still understand how the world works and have expectations over what I should see and shouldn’t see,” said Pavlick, who is currently studying how to teach AI systems common sense by interacting with them in virtual reality. To her, COMET represents “really exciting progress, but what’s missing is the actual reference aspect. The word apple is not an apple. That meaning has to exist in some form that’s not the language itself.”
Nazneen Rajani, a senior research scientist at Salesforce, is pursuing a similar goal, but she believes the full potential of neural language models is far from tapped. She’s investigating whether they can learn to reason about commonsense scenarios involving basic physics, like the fact that tipping over a jar with a ball inside will typically cause the ball to drop out. “The real world is really complicated,” Rajani said. “But natural language is like a low-dimensional proxy for how the real world works.” Sure, neural networks can be taught to predict the next word from a text prompt, but that shouldn’t be their limit. “They can learn more complex stuff.”
Choi and her colleagues are also working on ways to augment COMET with labeled visual scenes instead of just text. “We took all these images from movies or TV shows where some interesting things are happening,” Choi said. “The annotations look great; the model predictions look exciting.”
I asked Choi if COMET’s approach—combining incrementally better neural networks with improved commonsense-knowledge bases—was still, essentially, building a ladder to the moon. She conceded that her dream would be to have a neural network that could learn from knowledge bases without human supervision, the same way language models like GPT-2 already learn by ingesting reams of raw text.
But just as Winston Churchill quipped that “democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried,” Choi considers COMET’s flawed but promising approach to be “a fair deal.” Even if these neural networks can’t reach the stars, she thinks they’re the only way to get off the ground. “Without that, we are not going anywhere,” she said. “With [knowledge bases] alone, we cannot do anything. It’s COMET that can actually fly in the air.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Clouds need containers, and Containers-as-a-Service smooths the way | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Latest State of the Cloud report shows CaaS now the second-ranked Platform-as-a-Service offering in use among cloud-driven enterprises, right behind Database-as-a-Service. Why CaaS now?
Containers are well regarded for the flexibility they add to application development and deployment, especially when it comes to moving application workloads between clouds, between clouds and on-premises systems, or even from one on-premises system to another. However, effectively building a complex containerized environment still takes skills and experience. Enter Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS), a variation of Platform-as-a-Service that has been around as a concept for a few years, and lately is being embraced in a big way to speed up container adoption.So, is CaaS just another "as-a-Service" term from vendors intended to confuse the market and wrap their offerings in some glorious-sounding "aaSy" package? Or is there more to it? 
The data suggests CaaS may be serving a righteous purpose. The latest survey of 750 IT executives from Flexera's 2020 State of the Cloud Report (originally launched by Rightscale), finds a majority of cloud adopters, 53 percent, also use CaaS, which is on the upswing as containers become a mainstream part of enterprise development and operations environments. Notably, CaaS is now the second-ranked Platform-as-a-Service offering now in use among cloud-driven enterprises, up from sixth place in last year's survey. Database-as-a-Service tops this year's list with 62 percent. "Organizations are driving this shift due to their growing interest in leveraging containers to speed deployment, scale operations, and increase the efficiency of workloads running in the cloud," the survey's authors state. In terms of fastest-growing technologies, CaaS ranked second with 17 percent year-over-year growth, right behind IoT services at 21 percent. Another fast-growing category, machine learning and artificial intelligence, also saw 17 percent annual growth. Overall, the survey, conducted in the first quarter of 2020, finds rising adoption of public and hybrid cloud solutions, with AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud taking significant shares of the market, explored in Larry Dignan's analysis of the results here at ZDNet.
Along with their foundational cloud offerings, many organizations are also choosing CaaS offerings from these public cloud providers to enhance and accelerate application delivery. AWS' Elastic Container Service and Elastic Kubernetes Service (ECS/EKS) experienced substantial adoption, with 54 percent using it, up from 44 percent in last year's Flexera cloud report. Another 24 percent planning to adopt ECS/EKS. Azure Container Service adoption reached 46 percent (up from 28 percent last year), and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) reached 24 percent, up from 15 percent.  CaaS provides numerous benefits, as pointed out in an informative overview by Scalyr's Eric Olsson. CaaS can bring a good balance of speed and control to deployments, he notes. "Agile methodologies shortened the development and testing pieces while cloud computing has shortened the deployment piece. Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) further improved the time it takes to get a feature to customers. In addition to these, containers can give you a more powerful and flexible solution. But with all these pieces come additional configuration and complexity." 
The rise in CaaS adoption may be helping to alleviate some of the challenges with technical expertise and migration issues involved in containerization, the Flexera survey's authors state. Lack of expertise is the top challenge for container use, cited as a major issue by 41 percent of respondents. Another 38 percent regard this as "somewhat" of a challenge. Migrating traditional apps to containers is the second-ranked challenge, cited by 34 percent as a major issue, as is security. More than one-fourth, 26%, even note that their service providers lack expertise in container technology. "The resource challenges can be attributed to the relatively recent adoption of container technology," the survey's authors point out. "Migrating traditional applications to containers is problematic because containers are optimized for microservices, while traditional apps aren't."The use of Docker and Kubernetes continues to be considerable, the survey also shows. Close to two-thirds (65 percent) of organizations use Docker, and 14 percent plan to use it. Fifty-eight percent are using Kubernetes, a container orchestration tool that leverages Docker, and another 22 percent plan to use it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New MacBook Pro details leak | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Looks like the 13-inch MacBook Pro is getting a refresh real soon. Or maybe not.
The coronavirus pandemic has changed a lot of things, but one thing that it hasn't changed is Apple releasing new products. And benchmarks test results suggest that Apple has a new 13-inch MacBook Pro in the works.Well, maybe it won't be the 13-inch model, but more on that in a moment.Must read:Can a simple charging mistake cause your MacBook Pro to overheat?Twitter user @_rogame discovered 3DMark benchmarks for the new MacBook Pro.
As you might imagine, there's not a whole lot of information.
The i7-1068NG7 processor is a 10th-gen Intel Ice Lake-U chip that as of yet has not been officially confirmed yet. The switch to Ice Lake-U from Whiskey Lake-U is likely to be a significant performance boost. Given the spec of this system, it seems to be a high-end offering and would cost in excess of $3,000. It's likely that Apple would release a more affordable version powered by a Core i5 processor too. 
The most interesting this about this "leak" is the suggestion that this may not be a 13-inch MacBook Pro, but instead a new 14-inch model -- Apple's bumped the 15-inch MBP to 16-inch, so why not upgrade the 13-inch to 14-inch?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LineageOS source code, OS builds, and signing keys were unaffected, developers said.
Hackers have gained access to the core infrastructure of LineageOS, a mobile operating system based on Android, used for smartphones, tablets, and set-top boxes.The intrusion took place last night, on Saturday, at around 8 pm (US Pacific coast), and was detected before the attackers could do any harm, the LineageOS team said in a statement published less than three hours after the incident.The LineageOS team said the operating system's source code was unaffected, and so were any operating system builds, which had been already paused since April 30, because of an unrelated issue.Signing keys, used to authenticate official OS distributions, were also unaffected, as these hosts were stored separately from the LineageOS main infrastructure.LineageOS developers said the hack took place after the attacker used an unpatched vulnerability to breach its Salt installation.
Salt is an open-source framework provided by Saltstack that is usually deployed and used to manage and automate servers inside data centers, cloud server setups, or internal networks.Earlier this week, cyber-security firm F-Secure disclosed two major vulnerabilities in the Salt framework that could be used to take over Salt installations.
The two vulnerabilities were CVE-2020-11651 (an authentication bypass) and CVE-2020-11652 (a directory traversal), which, when combined, could allow attackers to bypass login procedures and run code on Salt master servers left exposed on the internet.According to reports from Salt server owners, attacks exploiting these two bugs began sometime yesterday. In some instances, attackers planted backdoors on hacked servers. In other instances, they deployed cryptocurrency miners.There are currently more than 6,000 Salt servers left exposed online that can be exploited via this vulnerability, if left unpatched. Patches for the Salt vulnerabilities have been released earlier this week. Salt servers should normally be deployed behind a firewall and not left exposed on the internet.The LineageOS team has taken down all of its servers last night, to investigate the incident and patch vulnerable servers.This marks the second time a major operating system was hacked in the past year. In July 2019, hackers breached Canonical's GitHub account, however, the Ubuntu source code was also unaffected.Updated at 8:15pm to add that the same Salt vulnerability has also been used to breach servers operated by the Ghost blogging platform and the Digicert certificate authority.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I got Quest's new COVID-19 antibody test and it was strange | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week, Quest Diagnostics announced a new direct-to-consumer test for coronavirus antibodies. So I tried it.
Sometimes, I'm not alone with my thoughts.
Many people -- some of whom I know -- are convinced they've already had coronavirus. On the West Coast, there are rumors the virus arrived much earlier than first thought. And, yes, at the end of last year, I caught a bug that demonstrated some of the symptoms and lasted two weeks. Since then, of course, I've been convinced it was COVID-19, while my wife -- a scientist -- has snorted elegantly, but derisively.Last week, Quest Diagnostics declared its antibody tests were now available to anyone. As I am truly anyone, I thought I'd try it. After all, if there's one thing that our nation hasn't quite prioritized or perfected during this crisis, it's the need for as much testing as possible.We're now just pieces of software, after all. Test it, test it, test it.
What transpired with this Quest experience was a little strange. And a model of the life that is to come.First, I went online to GetQuestTest and made an appointment. All I had to do to secure one was to answer several simple questions about my identity and current health.
Somehow, there are several Quest Diagnostics centers not too far from my house. Some had appointments for the same day. Others, the next day. I made an appointment at the closest one.You have to pay upfront, naturally. Your health is a business in the US, a little like everything else. As soon as your credit card clears, you get an email confirming your appointment and containing a QR code. I arrived slightly early and was met by no friendly receptionist whatsoever. The waiting area was completely empty. There was no evidence a receptionist had ever even had lunch there.This really was the future, and I'm not sure I liked it. I enjoy a little warm reassurance any time I'm doing something medical, don't you?Here, there was just a screen, not dissimilar to those at airports that photograph your face and compare it to your passport photo.At Quest, you hold up your phone, display your QR code on the screen, and ping, you're checked in.I sat down. No other customers were in the waiting room. All was a little eerie. Until, that is, I heard two female voices chatting and laughing. Yet I couldn't see them. So the whole thing bordered on the slightly macabre, as I sat in this apparently deserted room, yet could hear faraway giggles.At exactly the minute of my appointment, a phlebotomist emerged in full protective clothing. She took me to her quarters, sat me down, found a suitable vein, prepared her needle, and forgot to tell me she was going straight in. I'm not (excessively) squeamish, so I was amused at the nurse's "oops, sorry" as I uttered a mild ow. Perhaps she was a junior phlebotomist.Quest had warned there might be an examination of my temperature. That didn't happen. Nor were any questions asked about my health. It was in and out. Testing as fast food.This was the efficiency of the new world, I feared, one in which we robotically and regularly examine the minutiae of our innards, with a view to knowing them better and sometimes fearing the worst.At least the phlebotomist and I managed to chat about my silly name, my reason for getting the test, and whether it was possible to stay sane in the current circumstances. We concluded it wasn't.The whole process was absurdly smooth. Perhaps for $129 it should be. I couldn't help, though, consider the simple ways in which it bypassed at least some of what had occurred in the past. Just as with One Medical's primary care system -- in which Alphabet is invested -- you go online instead of calling, and you make an appointment. Yet here, you're greeted by no one in the waiting area and the human contact is reduced to an absolute minimum.Tech wins again.But what about the results, I hear you groan. The phlebotomist promised them within 24 to 48 hours.48 hours went by. No results. On the third day, however, an email telling me the answer was ready. I went to the Quest site and clicked on the verdict, with my wife peering at it over my shoulder.She instantly snorted. This time, less than elegantly, I thought. She's always right about this sort of thing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ghost blogging platform servers hacked and infected with crypto-miner | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ghost platform got hacked via the same vulnerability that allowed hackers to breach LineageOS servers hours before.
A serious hacking campaign is currently underway, and tens of companies have been hacked already, ZDNet has learned from security researchers keeping an eye on the attacks.For the past 24 hours, hackers have been mass-scanning the internet for Salt, a type of software used to manage and automate servers inside data centers, cloud server clusters, and enterprise networks.Attackers have been exploiting two recently-patched bugs to gain access to Salt servers and then deploy a cryptocurrency miner.
Earlier today, ZDNet reported that hackers managed to breach the servers of LineageOS, a mobile operating system.A second major hack surfaced a few hours later after our initial report. The second victim is Ghost, a Node.js-based blogging platform, built and advertised as a simpler alternative to WordPress.
In a status page, the Ghost developer team said they detected an intrusion into their backend infrastructure systems at around 1:30am UTC.Ghost devs said the hackers used CVE-2020-11651 (an authentication bypass) and CVE-2020-11652 (a directory traversal) to take control over its Salt master server.
The blogging company said that while hackers had access to the Ghost(Pro) sites and Ghost.org billing services, they didn't steal any financial information or user credentials.Instead, Ghost said the hackers installed a cryptocurrency miner."The mining attempt spiked CPUs and quickly overloaded most of our systems, which alerted us to the issue immediately," Ghost developers said.Similar to LineageOS, Ghost devs took down all servers, patched systems, and redeployed everything online after a few hours.
A security researcher who requested we not use his name for this report said the attacks were most likely carried out with an automated vulnerability scanner that detected outdated Salt installs, and then automatically exploited the two bugs to install the crypto-mining malware."It is very possible that the threat actor behind these scans doesn't even know the type of companies they're breaching right now," the researcher told ZDNet in a Twitter chat. "We're seeing unpatched Salt servers at banks, web hosters, and Fortune 500 companies.""Pretty soon ransomware gangs are going to start scanning for this bug, and we're gonna see mayhem, with ransomware deployed at some huge targets."Some of these intrusions are currently being reported on a GitHub thread, with similar reports of an attacker planting a cryptocurrency miner on hacked Salt systems. Our source has identified the attacker behind most of these intrusions as the Kinsing botnet.Saltstack, the company behind the Salt software, published patches earlier this week to address the two vulnerabilities. Companies are advised to either patch the Salt servers or secure them behind a firewall. There are currently around 6,000 Salt servers exposed on the internet.Updated post publication to add that the Digicert certificate authority and the Xen Orchestra hosting service have also had servers breached using the same Salt vulnerability.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Businesses and consumers are finding new and innovative ways to work and play online, showing how wide the computing device landscape has become.
In an attempt to reduce the spread of coronavirus, many millions of people are now working from home rather than commuting to offices.That has put huge pressure on technology teams to make working from home possible, and has also forced many of us to rethink the tools that we use.
Foremost among those tools is the PC. Sales have been in steady decline, with occasional upticks, for some years now, and the first three months of this year continued that trend -- but for different reasons. SEE: Working from home: Success tips for telecommuters (free PDF)Much of that first-quarter decline was down to limited supply, with China's PC factories closing early in the year due to the coronavirus. The impact of that shortage was amplified because once the coronavirus spread around the world, there was a sudden increase in demand for PCs as companies and consumers tried to get hold of laptops for work, education or entertainment at home.
"Once coronavirus-related lockdowns expanded to other regions, there were new, sudden pockets of PC demand for remote workers and online classrooms that PC manufacturers could not keep up with," noted analyst firm Gartner.A minor but interesting consequence seems to be an increased interest in PC alternatives -- whether because of lack of supply or simply because businesses and consumers have had to respond to changing circumstances with limited budgets.
For example, the Raspberry Pi Foundation has noted that sales have rocketed during the coronavirus crisis, which it puts down to people buying the tiny computers to end battles over the single home PC during lockdown. The lastest Raspberry Pi might be diminutive, but it's powerful enough to take on the role of budget computer if need be. Chromebooks, which are slightly easier to work with if you don't have the technical skills to play with a Pi, have also been selling well.And it's not only harassed parents looking for extra PCs that have been getting creative. Here at ZDNet we've also written about how councils have been digging old laptops out of storage, putting Linux on them or otherwise lightening the operating system load, and sending them out to allow staff to work from home. An old or lower-spec device is good enough for many employees, especially if your teams only need to access cloud-based tools and/or virtual desktop services. It's been pointed out that without the option of using a wide range of cloud-computing services businesses would be in even more trouble. The same could be say about ageing hardware that has been pressed back into service.None of this means the PC is obsolete -- it's still the business workhorse, and it's what I'm typing on right now, just that it's not the only option. And it's far too early to tell how this will play out in future. What's very likely is that many of those staff who are now working from home will be there for some time to come; and even after the crisis has passed, remote working will be a bigger part of our lives than ever before.Many organisations -- budgets permitting, in what are likely to be tough times ahead -- will be looking to re-equip those home workers with better hardware. But some may look at the slimmed-down devices they are using and decide that the days of the one-size-fits-all computing device have now passed.SEE: Coronavirus: Business and technology in a pandemicThe make-do-and-mend attitude may continue -- Gartner certainly expects further declines in PCs sales as companies focus on saving money. Meanwhile, rival analyst firm IDC argues that companies that have kept their staff in offices will have to invest more in remote infrastructure, and consumers will long to upgrade their PCs -- both developments that will create "a steady, long-range tailwind for PC and monitor markets."But it's also worth remembering that, when it comes to the choice of computing devices, a few years back it was a PC or nothing.  Now we have a wide range of devices, from single-board computers to tablets that can fill in where the fully fledged PC isn't needed, or available. We should celebrate the ingenuity of those people who are finding new ways of using technology to work, learn or just have fun.Have you changed the way you use technology for work in the current crisis?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Australia's COVIDSafe contact tracing story is full of holes and we should worry | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The government's coronavirus strategy bets heavily on an unproven COVID-19 tracing app, but the lack of a working back end and ham-fisted messaging risks the loss of the public's trust.
The message from Prime Minister Scott Morrison is simple, patronising, and dangerously misleading: Download the COVIDSafe app and we can start letting you out of coronavirus lockdown.
It's misleading because there's no evidence that a so-called "contact tracing" app will be a net benefit. Someone should've checked that up front.It's dangerous because much of the official messaging is about being "safe" and "protecting" you.The COVIDSafe strategy is technological hubris. Blind faith that an app can replace, or at least substantially enhance, the urgent labour-intensive detective work of contact tracing."The lure of automating the painstaking process of contact tracing is apparent. But to date, no one has demonstrated that it's possible to do so reliably despite numerous concurrent attempts," wrote researchers and academics at the Brookings Institution.
"We worry that contact tracing apps will serve as vehicles for abuse and disinformation, while providing a false sense of security to justify reopening local and national economies well before it is safe to do so."COVIDSafe doesn't do what contact tracers do. It merely logs which other COVIDSafe users you've been near, ready for later analysis, should one of you test COVID-19 positive.
That won't pick up potential infection paths such as random unrelated people buying a takeaway muffin from the same cafe across several days, taking moments to do so. It won't notice you sliding your hand along a dirty handrail.That's why Apple and Google's partnership to develop a tracing-friendly API has been labelled as "exposure notification" apps instead.The Brookings researchers detail flaws such as false positives leading people to ignore repeated alerts, when people are close but safely separated by walls, or using personal protective equipment (PPE)."Because most exposures flagged by the apps will not lead to infection, many users will be instructed to self-quarantine even when they have not been infected," they write."A person may put up with this once or twice, but after a few false alarms and the ensuing inconvenience of protracted self-isolation, we expect many will start to disregard the warnings."False negatives are equally problematic. People might leave their phones in their car, or the app might just fail. And it's not like the 1.5 metres for 15 minutes rule is magic. Even the most fleeting encounter can be unlucky.As has also been pointed out, people might trust the magic of technology more than their own judgement, a phenomenon called automation bias."Contact tracing apps therefore cannot offer assurance that going out is safe, just because no disease has been reported in the vicinity," the Bookings team writes."Contact tracing is a public health intervention, not an individual health one. It can reduce the spread of disease through the population, but does not confer direct protection on any individual."
Yet last week Morrison said that using the app was "like putting on sunscreen to go out into the sun"."It protects you, it protects your family, it protects your loved ones, it protects our health workers, and it protects your job, and the jobs of many others, because it enables us to move forward and to get the economy back on the track we want it to be on," he said.Morrison also said that Australia is "on the road back to a COVID-safe economy". Spot the contrived slogan?Robert Hillard, chair of the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA), said: "You could think about contact tracing as a digital vaccine with our contact data being the virtual antibodies". Both Morrison and Hillard are wrong.Even the name of the app, COVIDSafe, implies that it will in fact make you safe. It won't. It can't. There's a reason the HIV/AIDS public health community has spent more than three decades talking about "safer sex" not "safe sex".
Like a frustrated parent on a long road trip, Morrison has responded to us like children demanding to know "are we there yet? are we there yet? are we there yet?" with a figurative "yes alright, shut up, be quiet, and we'll stop at Macca's for ice cream."Or since this is Australia, at a pub for a beer. "A cold one later on today," as he put it."The first step to getting back to that is downloading COVIDSafe," Morrison said on Friday."If [Australians are] looking forward to doing it in a pub, well, that is a prerequisite to even getting to that conversation."Health Minister Greg Hunt used the same playbook. "Want to go to the footy? Download the app," Hunt tweeted on Saturday.This tells you something about Morrison's character, and perhaps something about Australia's too. Morrison doesn't trust us to trust him and do the right thing. So we need to be bribed with bread and circuses, or beer and football, before we'll risk trusting him.The thing is, Australians aretrusting Morrison, at least so far.Last week's polling by Essential showed that 70% of us rate the government's response as good, and 68% think the response is about right.Our attitudes to the tracing app show that, yes, there are security and privacy concerns, but far more of us believe the app will help limit the spread of COVID-19 than not. Some 40% said they would download the app to their phone, with 28% undecided.That polling was done April 23-26, so mostly before the app's launch on April 26 and the subsequent PR blitz -- and before the problems started to emerge.Still, by Sunday, the government claimed that more than 4.25 million Australians had done the deed.But COVIDSafe apps may be logging close contacts -- at least those that are turned on and working -- with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reporting that none of the data is going to contact tracers."The rules on privacy are being finalised, along with final IT testing," a Department of Health spokesman told the ABC.It's actually good that we're locking down the rules and testing the systems before they go live, so why weren't we told that?"The system will be operational next week ahead of the decision on possible easing of restrictions," something we're told will be happening this Friday at a National Cabinet meeting.Morrison is constantly saying that the key metric is app downloads. "The COVIDSafe app is the major obstacle now, between us freeing up a lot of these restrictions, in a cautious way, in a careful way," he said, but right now that's simply an assertion.And if there's modelling that shows how COVIDSafe usage rates translate into a reduced risk of infection, why can't we see it? How much modelling will inform the National Cabinet if the back end isn't operational?Back in school, we knew that the maths students who couldn't show their working out didn't know what they were doing, and were just bluffing it.A pandemic is too important, too dangerous for people to be bluffing it.
Your writer was one of the politicians, industry, analysts, and media people at last Friday's Australian Strategic Policy Institute roundtable, discussing Labor's cyber resilience discussion paper and other matters under the Chatham House Rule.With the COVIDSafe app, government is taking a different approach than with, say, Australia's controversial encryption legislation. They're going to table legislation in Parliament, even though they'd said that the ministerial determination was enough. They say they're releasing source code.We also noted that government has been handed a challenge with the identity-matching legislation. The Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security, in a bipartisan decision, demanded that it be completely rewritten.Australia's surveillance laws, meanwhile, are hitting the social license problem.How will the Morrison government deal with that?"Too much technology policy that is done by assertion," said one participant."Politicians will say 'This is the way it works and no one needs to be worried about it' when there's a great suspicion that that politician doesn't actually know what they're talking about in the first place," they said."If you want the public trust you, you've got to trust them enough to have an open conversation with them."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zelda would be better if Link had a gun - Reader’s Feature</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A reader offers a tongue-in-cheek glimpse of what games like Dark Souls and The Legend Of Zelda would be like with guns instead of swords.
I’d like to start this feature by recalling one of the most beloved scenes in cinematic history, and one which I’m sure your readers are familiar with. The scene in question appears in the Steven Spielberg 1981 classic, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indiana Jones’s friend, Marion, has been kidnapped in the bustling streets of Cairo, with Indy in frantic pursuit, trying desperately to tail her abductors and get her back.
Suddenly the crowd disperses, revealing a menacingly cloaked figure wielding an equally intimidating scimitar. Taunting Jones, the assassin demonstrates his formidable swordsmanship and the scene is clearing setting up an epic showdown between the two. Of course, what happens next is even more epic; Indy casually takes out his revolver and dispatches his adversary with a single shot. It’s perhaps the most iconic subversion of expectations a movie has ever achieved.
Now, I’d like to direct your attention to an equally beloved and epic video game, Dark Souls. I’m sure many of you have played this seminal classic before, but in case anyone’s unfamiliar with the game, let me tell you, it’s hard. Like, reeeeaaally hard. Even the lowest minions can pose a real threat to an overconfident or ill-prepared player. A particular moment early on in the game stands out in my memory perhaps more so than other part of the game.
After around 10 minutes, you encounter your first Black Knight, and trust me, these guys don’t mess around! The first time I took him on, he dashed at me with unbelievable speed and finished me off with just two or three vicious swipes from his sword. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the same thing happened around 50 times before I eventually, through sheer grit and determination, defeated him. I felt triumphant, for sure, but also drained and frustrated in equal measure.
Now, let’s pretend that arduous routine never happened at all. Let’s imagine, instead, that as that intimidating Black Knight was dashing towards me, his cockiness almost visible through his impenetrable visor, I simply whipped out a sawn-off, double-barrelled shotgun and blew the muppet’s head off. You see where I’m going with this? Not only would there be hardly any time lost dying over and over, but all the other minions would witness how powerful I am and flee in terror. I could simply progress straight to the bosses, finish them off with ease and the game would be over a lot quicker. It would, simply put, be a better game.
Let us turn our attention to another game, the recent classic, Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. Now, I’m loath to criticise a game as loved as this, but in the name of providing enlightenment, I’m afraid I must. I was constantly being ambushed by Ganon’s minions in this game wherever I went. I couldn’t even pick apples without suddenly being surrounded by a score of enemies and having to fend them off with a pathetic excuse for a sword which was about as useful as a toothpick.
Why can’t I just pull out a minigun from my satchel and waste them all in a few seconds? It would make the game so much fun and so less time-consuming. The expression ‘bringing a knife to a gun fight’ exists for a reason. Guns are better and more fun, it’s that simple.
I don’t even think it would be too difficult a feature to implement into the game’s design. The guns could still break, like the melee weapons did, if you don’t maintain them well enough. Link could find or buy better armour with more ammo slots and pockets, allowing him to carry a greater arsenal as the game progresses. Just as in the real game, better attire could also unlock special abilities, like a jetpack for traversing the mountains instead of wasting 15 minutes of my life watching Link climb 15 metres only to then slide down 20 metres because it’s raining.
I picture Link starting off with his first gun, a rubbish .25 calibre peashooter, and by the end of the game, a walking one-man army, carrying grenades, bombs, rocket launchers, automatic rifles… the possibilities are endless. Nintendo could even introduce paid-for DLC and loot boxes if they were worried about how profitable the game would be, with players being able to buy gun modifications, skins, and even witty one-liners Link could quip as he’s mowing down the next bunch of crazy fools dumb enough to get in his way.
And picture how glorious the final battle with Ganon would be! This huge, towering beast, getting ready to lay waste to the whole population beneath it, only for Link to order a nuclear drone strike right on his head. There could even be a cut scene where Link turns to princess Zelda and winks at her, as the mushroom cloud rises on the horizon, but I jest and I’m getting ahead of myself!
Now look, I understand the whole point of adventure games is the challenge; to slowly but surely build up your character to overcome the odds and emerge victorious, the hard work and investment paying off in the end. You could even make the argument that these games are a metaphor for dealing with real-life’s hardships and overcoming them through strength, faith, determination, and whatever other human virtues you care to name. I also concede that some games wouldn’t benefit from the introduction of guns.
I can’t imagine how they would enhance, say, your typical 15-minute game of FIFA, for example. I would also imagine that EA would be nervous about introducing such a feature because the media outcry would be immeasurable. But the argument I would make is that if games are about empowering the player, what would better achieve that goal? Equipping them with a tree branch or equipping them with a plasma rifle?
Anyway, these are just my thoughts and I would love to hear what everyone else thinks. But just remember this: Grand Theft Auto and Call Of Duty sell much more than games like Okami, Kirby and Catherine, and that’s for a reason…

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to run faster if you've just started running</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’ve started running for the first time during lockdown and you’re still going, congratulations for making it this far.
They say it takes eight weeks for a new behaviour to become a habit so you’re dead close to making this running lark stick.
But once you’ve gotten over the initial pain, breathing difficulties, tired legs and incessant hunger, you’ll probably start to wonder how you can improve.
Maybe you dream of going longer – and if you want to know about training for your first marathon, you can read what it’s like to run one after 12 weeks of training.
If distance isn’t something you’re that bothered about, however, then another good marker of progress is how fast you’re running your 5 or 10K and how quickly you recover afterward.
Everyone has their own reasons for running. If you’re going for a jog just to get out of the house and clear the mind, maybe you’re not bothered about improving. Running might just be a tool to keep things ticking over.
Even if you do want to race, it’s worth pointing out that the race is only with yourself.
You may decide to join Parkrun (a free weekly 5K that takes place in parks across the world) or Run Through (a series of cheap 5K, 10K and half marathons through UK parks) when lockdown is over but the goal is running to finish, walking away injury-free at the end and possibly beating your own time.
Of course, many of us do want to get faster – and Parkrun is the perfect post-lockdown environment to see just what you can do. Who knows when the first meet may be but to run your fastest, you’ve got to start putting in the work now.
So, where to start?
Whether you’re new to running or you’ve been clocking up miles on the road for years, it’s so tempting to go out and just run. You run your same route with the same playlist at the same speed.
Some days it’ll feel easy, other days hard. But once you’re actually used to the routine, you’re not benefitting massively from it anymore. To improve, the body needs to be tested – thrown new challenges.
You want to split your week up into different types of runs. Sunday might be your long run – maybe a 10K.
Then you’re going to do one tempo run which might be your 5K, where you’re working at 70-80% of your overall effort.
And then you could have a chilled recovery run in between where you go out for 5 or 7K, not focussing on time but just moving and feeling relaxed.
It doesn’t have to be measured in distance either – you could easily set your long run to be two hours, your tempo to be 50 minutes and a recovery to be 30 minutes.
If you get used to running 6K in 35 minutes and that’s all you do day in, day out, it’s going to be really hard to push beyond those 35 minutes.
Lots of runners swear by attending weekly track sessions. There are any number of track clubs out there and even if you don’t want to commit, you can often just turn up, pay a small fee and take part in the odd session.
There are also tonnes of gyms who now offer treadmill interval classes where you switch between hill sprints on the treadmill and HIIT or weights on the floor. Both are incredible for increasing your VO2 max (your maximal oxygen uptake) – making you fitter and able to withstand hard work for longer.
At the moment, however, clubs aren’t meeting, and many gyms and tracks are closed. That doesn’t mean you have to swerve off the sprints.
It may be harder to make yourself do sprints on your own but it really is worth trying to include a little speed work into your regime.
If you can, give yourself one run a week where you’re going between sprinting and jogging. Remember: intervals are short, intense bursts of effort followed by slightly longer recovery times. You want to be working at 90% of your overall maximum effort during those intervals and then following it up with a really easy jog.
A park might be the best place to do this kind of training as you can split a round path circuit more easily into 100m chunks. Run fast for 800m, jog for 800m and repeat four times. Then try sprinting for 400m and jogging for 800m and repeat that twice.
Fartlek is Swedish for ‘speed play’ and it’s all about switching up how fast you run over the course of an outing. It’s much less structured than classic interval training and goes between easy, moderate and hard effort.
It’s really good for keeping you on your toes without feeling boring or too difficult. If you hate intervals, this might be for you because you can turn your tempo run into a fartlek session – or as PT Hannah Lewin recommends, ‘include sprint intervals within your normal run’.
Turn your run into a game. Every time you see a red car or a postbox or cherry tree, you have to sprint for a minute. Every time you see a traffic light, you’ve got to sprint for 30 seconds.
It’s not about your watch or Strava, this kind of training is about getting out there and having fun while challenging yourself to run faster frequently.
The gyms aren’t open but that doesn’t mean you can’t work on your strength training at home.
Strength training is so important for running. Not only does it make us faster, it also helps to reduce the risk of injury by working out muscular imbalances, strengthening up even tiny muscles and improving our core stability.
‘Both interval training and strength training will have a big impact on speeding up your times,’ celebrity PT Alice Liveing tells us.
Try to carve out two sessions a week during which you focus on body weight and if you have them, kettlebells or dumbbells. Either download an app like FIIT which has hundreds of amazing strength classes or set yourself up with a circuit.
‘The right strength training will help you to generate more force and have a better transferance of energy,’ says Graham Barrett from Barrett’s Fitness.
It can also help stabilise the hip joints – an area which often gets weaker from sitting at a desk job all day. Get your hip joints stronger and your energy system working more efficiently, Graham says, and you’ll enjoy ‘better running efficiency’.
Have a go at the following (2 rounds, 1 minute rest at the end of the circuit):
If you don’t know how to do these moves, pop over to YouTube where there are loads of tutorials.
Those Romanian deadlifts are great for stretching out tight hamstrings before you go into a split squat which will test how well balanced you are (try a single-leg deadlift to really work isometrically and smooth out any imbalances).
But you don’t want to just be working your legs all the time – you need a strong core and upper body to move efficently.
It’s hard to get better at something without doing it. If you do start training for a bigger goal (say, half marathon), then the chances are that you’ll get slightly quicker on your shorter distances.
You might not be great at sprinting (that requires different muscle fibres) but 5 and 10Ks may feel easier if you’re clocking up 20 or 30-mile weeks.
A few years ago, I ran a half marathon having done hardly any running and lots of strength work and clocked in at 1:53 – not too shabby.
The following year, I ran a half marathon a month before I was due to run Paris Marathon – the 13.1 miler was part of my tapering. I ran it in 1:44. Proof that you need weight work but that more miles do make a difference.
Just remember to pace yourself and not to suddenly increase your weekly milage by a lot – that way lies injury.
Nell McAndrew, glamour model-turned-marathon star (with a ridiculous PB of 2:54:39), tells Metro.co.uk: ‘I ran my fasted 5K, 10K, half marathon and marathon times when I was doing higher mileage.
‘It’s as if everything just clicked into place and running felt easier.’
Oh, and if you want to know how a running queen like Nell trains, she’s busy hosting free Instagram Live training sessions throughout the week.
If you’re looking for a challenge, you might want to check out Adidas Runner and FIIT trainer Adrienne Herbet’s ‘100K in May’ challenge.
It doesn’t matter how fast or slow you go – you could run 3K one day and 10K the next – it’s just about building up that running over the course of 30 days.
Why not have a go? Use the hashtag #100KinMay so that others can see your progress. And if you’re really struggling, Andrienne has said that her DMs are open in case you need an extra kick of encouragement!
This isn’t a technical tip but it’s a valid one nonetheless. I have four standard running playlists: 5K, 10K, half marathon, marathon.
Everything on my 5K list is on my marathon list but the 5K music tends to be a lot faster than a lot of the stuff on the marathon one.
During marathons or long runs, you might want to listen to podcasts, audiobooks or just get lost in the sound of nature/your own breath. It can be quite boring and exhausting listening to club music for nearly four hours. But for your shorter runs, you may find that listening to faster music helps.
Scientists believe that music really does help you to run faster because you end up synchronising your stride to the rhythm. It also regulates your stride and can help you to up your energy output by 7%.
You want to be aiming for tracks that are about 140-160bpm for moderate-to-high intensity (think: Franz Ferdinand’s Take Me out, DJ Fresh’s Golddust and Metallica’s Hardwired).
This might all sound like a lot to do just to run a few minutes or seconds faster during an amateur race or event.
If you’ve not got the time or can’t be bothered with it all, just pick one or two things to add into your weekly regime. It might simply be choosing a different playlist or deciding to run slightly faster whenever you see a red car.
Whatever you do, just enjoy it and stick with it – that’s more important than sprinting for your life, hating every second and vowing never to get out on the road again.

Price: Free to play
Mass For The Dead is a mobile game from Crunchyroll. It takes place in the same world as the Overlord anime. It has the same premise as well. You, the player, are trapped in a defunct MMORPG and must make the best of things. The main characters from the show all make appearances as either side characters or main characters while you go off on your own adventure. In terms of mechanics, it’s a fairly basic mobile RPG. You assemble a party, do battle with the bad guys, and advance the story with a smattering of extra events and other things to do. The game also includes auto attacking and a fast forward mode for easier grinding. It’s surprisingly decent for an anime spin-off game.
Price: Free
Google launched the official app to accompany its new Pixel Buds product. The app is fairly basic. You can see the battery charge in the left and right buds independently along with the charge case. You can also use it to turn Adaptive Sound on and off, view tutorials on gestures and use, control Google Assistant, and, the most valuable feature, the ability to ring your Pixel Buds if you lose them. The app is free to download and use. However, Google’s execution of this one has left more than one person confused and angry about it, hence the low Google Play rating.
Price: $6.99
Levelhead is a new platformer from the same developers of Crashlands. This is one entertaining little platform game. You build levels, share it with others, and play levels other people made. It’s almost like an indie version of Mario Maker. There is a campaign mode of sorts with 90 levels by the developers as well as a surprisingly good level creation process. You can even build a working calculator. The game is smooth and the mechanics are simple. It’s also free if you use Google Play Pass, which makes it one of the best games on Google Play Pass. As usual, Butterscotch Shenanigans has a hilarious trailer for the game, visible below. This is one of the best releases of 2020 so far.
Price: Free
TVUsage is a digital wellbeing app for Android TV owners. The app is fairly simple to use. It installs and then keeps track of your usage over three day increments. You can view your usage, set usage limits, and it even acts as a launcher of sorts. Additionally, it comes with an applock function in case you don’t want the kids to use a particular Android TV app. The app works perfectly on an Nvidia Shield TV device, but may have problems on Mi devices and Sony TVs. It’s free at least, though, so it doesn’t hurt to try it out.
Price: Free to play
Legend of Runeterra is a new card dueling game from Riot Games, developers of League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics. It plays a lot like other card dueling games like Hearthstone, Magic: The Gathering, and others. You assemble a deck, duel with other players, and try to be the last player standing. It includes a mix of classic card duel mechanics. For instance, you build decks around champions and that’s fairly normal. However, the champion levels up when certain conditions are met and cards can attack the same turn they are put into play, which is not normal. It’s an interesting entrant into the genre and you can learn a lot more in our guide here.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Android is an extremely customizable OS. You can change the entire home screen launcher, icon pack, wallpaper, and more. On some devices, you can even change the way your software behaves at a system level. You used to have to root your Android phone to allow this level of customization, but now it’s offered by default by a lot of smartphone OEMs.
Last week, we asked you how much you customize your Android phone. Do you just do simple things like change the icon layout and wallpaper? Or do you go all out and make a completely custom interface? Out of over 6,300 total votes across the website and Twitter, a surprising amount of you only customize a handful of things.
According to polls on the website and Twitter, the majority of Android Authority readers (43.58%) only customize a handful of things on their smartphones. Icon packs, wallpapers, and the general layout of the home screen are all easy enough customizations to make out of the box, so it’s no surprise to see this as the front runner in the poll.
Add that to the 18.3% of voters who say they customize very little on their smartphones, and you have a total of 61.88% of voters (or 3,931 participants) who only really customize the bare essentials.
30.64% of voters say they customize everything — icon packs, device themes, wallpapers, home screen launchers, etc. I’m assuming these are also the voters who used to (or still do) root their phones to add even more customization to their phones.
Finally, 7.48% of voters say they don’t customize anything at all.
Here are some of the best comments from last week’s poll explaining why they voted the way that they did:
That’s it for this week. As always, thanks for voting, thanks for the comments, and don’t forget to let us know what you thought of the results below!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Your guide

There are plenty of free cloud storage providers available, although not all of them are the same. They differ from one another in terms of features and the free space they offer.
In this post, we take a look at the 10 best free cloud providers that offer the most storage. But keep in mind that this list only contains reputable and well-known companies we’re willing to recommend. There are other providers out there that offer more free storage, but some of them are brand new to the market and seem sketchy because they try their hardest to keep their details (location, phone number, address…) hidden.
Not every provider is trustworthy. Uploading sensitive files to a cloud managed by a company that may have bad intentions is not a good idea. And if the provider is brand new to the market and their business plan doesn’t go as imagined, it can close shop overnight, possibly leaving you without access to your files.
If you already know what cloud storage is, how it works, and why you should use it, feel free to skip this section and scroll down to check out the list of the best cloud storage providers. Everyone else, keep reading.
The concept of cloud storage is easy to understand. The cloud is basically just a remote database. It’s a server maintained by the provider that lets you store your images, videos, documents, and other files. To access the files, all you need is your account login info and an internet connection.
But, why not store everything on my PC instead, you ask? One of the reasons is that by storing files to the cloud, you can access them from any device with an internet connection. If you store files on your PC, you can only access them from that PC.
Another reason is that your files are safer in the cloud then they are on your PC. If your computer can get damaged, lost, or stolen, you can say goodbye to all those vacation photos and your movie collection. You can also share files with other people more easily from the cloud, especially larger ones that can’t be attached to emails because of size limits.
An additional benefit of cloud storage comes into play when you buy a new PC. Instead of manually transferring your data from your old device to the new one, you can just log into your cloud account and, voila, all your files are right there on your new machine.
Of course, cloud storage isn’t perfect. It has its share of problems that you need to be aware of. The biggest one is that if someone gets ahold of your account login info, they’ll be able to get access to all the files stored in your account. You also need an internet connection to view the files in the cloud, which may cause problems for some at times — especially road warriors. 
Editor’s note: We’ll update this post with new providers once they launch or when current ones make changes to their free plans.
Degoo is far ahead of the competition, offering a whopping 100GB of free cloud storage. However, the service has a number of limitations in place you have to be aware of. The biggest one is that you can only upload files from one device. There’s no such limit for viewing or downloading files, though — you can do that on as many devices you want.
The service is supported by ads, and you have to log in at least once every 90 days to make sure your account stays active. With that in mind, Degoo definitely isn’t the most user-friendly cloud service on this list, but it does offer plenty of storage.
The nitty-gritty:
Co-founded by the controversial Kim Dotcom, Mega comes in second on this list by offering 50GB of free storage. But there’s a catch: the 50GB is available for the first 30 days only, after which the storage gets bumped down to 15GB. You can get extra storage by installing the desktop app (20GB) and the mobile app (15GB), although both expire after 180 days. You also get an additional 10GB of free storage for one year when a friend of yours signs up for the service.
Mega technically doesn’t have a size limit for the files you upload, but it does have bandwidth limit that’s pretty strict. You can upload a maximum of 1GB of data every six hours, which obviously means that the largest file you can upload is 1GB.
The nitty-gritty:
This is the cloud service I recommend to most people, provided they don’t need more than 15GB of storage. It’s super easy to use, is available on all the major platforms, and doesn’t contain ads. But one thing to keep in mind is that the 15GB of storage is shared between Drive, Gmail, and Photos.
Google Drive is well integrated with Gmail, allowing you to quickly save email attachments to Drive. The service also lets you share files with ease and allows you to easily back up your devices. This is by far my favorite cloud storage service.
The nitty-gritty:
Box is a popular and well-known cloud storage provider. It’s 10GB of free storage is generous, although not market-leading. There’s a file size limit in place for uploads that is set at 250MB.
The service offers standard features you get with most other providers. You can create folders to organize your files, share files with just a few clicks, and access your files from different platforms, among other things.
The nitty-gritty:
This provider isn’t as popular as Google Drive or Box, but it’s a great one nonetheless. You get 10GB of cloud storage for free and there’s no file size limit in place for uploads.
pCloud is packed with loads of great features. You can share files with ease, access your files from multiple devices across different platforms, and recover and access older versions of your account — up to 30 days. The service even has a built-in video and audio players. If you need more storage, you can opt for a monthly plan or a one-time “lifetime” fee.
The nitty-gritty:
Icedrive is a relatively new player on the market — it launched in January 2019. You get 10GB of free storage and a daily bandwidth of 3GB, which limits the size of the files you can upload.
Since it’s a newcomer, it doesn’t offer all the features you get with some of the bigger players. There’s no two-factor authentication available, nor is there file versioning. But Icedrive still has the main features you’d expect from a cloud storage and is a solid option overall.
The nitty-gritty:
MediaFire lets you store and share files with ease, with free users getting 10GB of free storage. Individual files are limited to a maximum of 4GB per upload.
The service lets you upload multiple files at once and can be used on various platforms including Windows, Android, and iOS. It supports all the major files out there, allowing you to upload images, videos, documents, and more. Unfortunately, the service is supported by ads, which can get annoying fast.
The nitty-gritty:
This cloud storage is mainly focused on media files (images, videos…), although you can store documents and other files as well. Users praise the service for its fast upload speeds as well as a decent amount of free storage at 10GB.
There’s a 5GB file size limit for uploads, which is quite generous. Apps are available for PC/Mac, Android, and iOS, so you can upload files and get access to them regardless of the device you’re using.
The nitty-gritty:
Syncplicity doesn’t stand out from the crowd, but it still gets the job done. You get all the basic features like the ability to sort files by folders, share files with others, and even tag them. The good news is that, unlike some other providers, Syncplicity doesn’t have a file size upload limit in place.
You get 10GB of space for your images, videos, documents, and other files. The service is available on all the major platforms and offers paid plans for those looking for extra storage.
The nitty-gritty:
The last free cloud storage service on this list is Microsoft’s OneDrive, which offers the least amount of space at just 5GB. But you can use it as part of your Microsoft account — if you already have one — so you don’t need to sign up for the service separately.
In addition to all the basic features you’d expect from a service like this, OneDrive also comes with a Personal Vault that adds an additional layer of security for those extra sensitive documents. But on free accounts, you can only store up to three files in it.
The nitty-gritty:
There’s a reason why the list above lacks a few big names. Apple’s iCloud service only offers 5GB of data, just like Microsoft’s OneDrive. But unlike OneDrive, iCloud is primarily aimed at those who own an Apple device. And if you sign up for the service with a PC, you only get 1GB of storage instead of five. Nevertheless, it’s a great service overall if you’re an Apple user and we have no problem recommending it, but just keep the storage limit in mind. If you need more space, opt for one of the providers mentioned in this post.
Dropbox is another great service that we recommend, although it didn’t make our list because it only offers 2GB of free cloud storage. That’s not much, but if it’s enough for you, we’re confident you’ll be happy with the service.
Amazon Drive is also a great service, offering 5GB of free storage to its users. That’s on par with OneDrive we included on our list, but we recommend Microsoft’s solution over Amazon’s because it’s more feature-packed and easier to use.
More free storage is always better, but it’s not the only thing you should focus on. For example, while Degoo offers the most storage at 100GB, I wouldn’t recommend it to users who don’t need that much space. The service has loads of limitations in place, one of them being that you can only upload files from a single device.
So before you sign up for a service, try to figure out how much online storage you actually need. If you need more than 50GB, then something like Degoo is your best option. But if just 10GB or even less will do, a service like Google Drive is a much better option.
There you have it — these are the 10 best cloud storage providers that offer the most space. We’ll update this post when new providers launch or current ones make changes to their free plans. In the meantime, let us know which of the services listed in this post would you consider signing up for.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Source: Apple
Apple TV+ shows started immediately with the streaming service’s launch in November 2019. Since then, we have seen a low but steady trickle of new series debut on the service, and now there’s enough content to really dive deep into its selections. But which series are the best Apple TV Plus shows? Good question, and one we aim to explore here. 
As you will see, the original Apple TV Plus series already has a variety of content; from children’s shows to more mature series just for their moms and dads.
Remember, if you buy a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV box, you get one year of the service for free (read more about it here.) For everyone else, you can sign up now for Apple TV Plus for $4.99 a month, following a seven-day free trial, at the link below. 
This is our favorite of the current crop of Apple TV Plus shows. It’s an alternate history tale, showing the Soviet Union winning the race to put a man on the moon in 1969. In response, the NASA of this timeline decides to keep going. Part of their plan is to recruit more women and minorities into the US space program much earlier than what happened in our reality. It’s a different look at how early space exploration could have happened.
Emily Dickinson is the real life US poet who inspired tons of other writers over the decades. This show examines a fictionalized version of Dickinson’s early life. The twist is that this incarnation of the poet, as played by Hailee Steinfeld, and her friends act and sound more like teenagers in modern times. It’s not exactly historically accurate, but it is entertaining.
We have read stories about fictional young reporters in school. However, this show tells the story of a real-life young journalist, Hilde Lysiak. As played by Brooklynn Prince in this series, the 11-year old Lysiak publishes her own newspaper for her community. Things take a big turn for her as she starts investigating a murder that happened near her home.
This reboot of the classic children’s TV series focuses on four kids. They attempt to solve mysteries that are tied into well-known books like The Jungle Book and Alice in Wonderland. If you have kids and want to encourage them to read more, this series might be a good first step.
This Apple TV Plus show is based on the best selling novel of the same name by William Landay. Chris Evans takes off his Captain America uniform and shield as the star of this series. He plays an assistant DA in a Massachusetts town, who suddenly has to deal with the fact that his son Jacob is accused of murdering a fellow classmate in school. This is an old-fashioned murder mystery, but with some family drama as well.
HBO’s Silicon Valley made a comedy out of the creation of tech startups. Mythic Quest does something similar. Instead of an internet app company, this show is about the workings of a video game developer. Specifically, it centers on the creator of an MMO game, and his team members that have to deal with his sometimes outrageous ideas and requests. Rob McElhinney, the co-creator of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, also co-created this show, and stars as its lead character Ian Grimm, who sometimes believes his job is to “create worlds”.
This series isn’t as flashy or as high concept as most of the other Apple TV Plus shows on this list. However, it may be more human and heartwarming. It’s an anthology show, with each episode following an emigrant as he or she tries to make a life in America. Episodes have shown the life of a Nigerian boy who comes to Oklahoma and becomes a cowboy, along with a Chinese woman who ends up winning a cruise for her family. It shows the American experience through many different eyes.
This sci-fi series takes place hundreds of years in the future, after an unnamed disaster strikes the Earth, and blinds all humans. The few survivors manage to stay alive, and one tribe of people, led by Aquaman’s Jason Momoa, weds an already pregnant woman. To their surprise, she has twins, both of which can see. This development gets the attention of a rival tribe, who wants the twins for their own purposes. This is a different sort of post-apocalyptic tale with heart and family.
M. Night Shyamalan is an executive producer of this thriller series, and also directed two of its episodes. The show itself fits with his dark storytelling themes. A young couple deal with the tragic death of their baby boy. However, the wife later starts to take care of a reborn doll that she thinks is really alive. The husband hires a nanny to help take care of their “child” but she seems to act like this thing is real as well. Get ready for some Shyamalan-style twists and turns in this series.

This show is by far the biggest high-concept series on Apple TV Plus. It also has the biggest stars, with Jennifer Aniston as a national morning news anchor who is shocked when her co-anchor, played by Steve Carell, is fired for alleged sexual misconduct. To make matters worse for Aniston’s character, she also has to deal with a rising young female reporter, played by Reese Witherspoon. The office and media politics can sometimes get a bit confusing and dull, but the performances by Aniston, Carell, Witherspoon and Billy Crudup as a news executive make this show very watchable. 
That’s our look at the best Apple TV Plus shows so far. We will update this list when more shows debut on the service. In the meantime which ones are your favorites?
Again, you can sign up for the service at the link below, which costs just $4.99 a month after a seven-day free trial.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s time for the Sunday giveaway! Like every week, we’re giving away a brand new Android phone to one lucky Android Authority reader.
A big congratulations to the winners of last week’s Samsung Galaxy S20 giveaway, Jannat A. from India.
This week we’re giving away a brand new OnePlus 8, courtesy of the Android Authority Newsletter!
Get caught up on the week’s top stories, reviews, and features by signing up for the Android Authority Weekly Newsletter. Every Sunday, you’ll receive an email alert with a roundup of the best content from the previous week.
The OnePlus 8 may not be a “Pro” or “Plus” model, but it’s not necessarily a lightweight. This Snapdragon 865-powered phone carries over a lot of the sex appeal from the larger OnePlus 8 Pro, with features such as a 90Hz display and rapid charging, for $200 less.
Whether you run the OnePlus 8 with the screen set to 60Hz or 90Hz, you’re going to get world-class performance. The phone fared well on benchmarks, besting 99% of other devices in the databases of 3DMark, Geekbench, and GFXBench.
The 4,300mAh battery of the OnePlus 8 is just 4.6% lower capacity than the Pro version, and much larger than the 3,800mAh pack in the OnePlus 7T. It consistently pushed through a day and a half of normal use for us, and sometimes extended close to one and three-quarters days. A 6.78-inch AMOLED screen, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage complete the package.

Google I/O 2020 would have taken place on May 12th, but it was cancelled. Despite that, it looks like Google is still pushing forward to release the Pixel 4a this month. It may not release on May 12th, but the leaks and rumors are flowing, so we expect to see the new phone fairly soon. We’ve got some new information in our Google Pixel 4a hub for you to check out. Better than that, we’ve also seen some alleged leaked images taken by the new phone. If these Pixel 4a images are real, we’re pretty excited.
The DJI Mavic Air 2 released this past week. More than just an iterative update, this is a true “Mavic drone,” in design and function. It looks like a typical Mavic drone, and it folds down for transport in the same way. The upgrades are impressive as well. The Mavic Air 2 is the first DJI consumer drone rated for 10km, that’s 6.2 miles of range. It’s also equipped with a new 1/2-inch camera, similar to some newer phones with a 48MP sensor that bins down to fantastic 12MP images. It’ll start shipping soon starting at $799.
You told us: Some of you like to customize your phones, but the rest of you just use a default layout. That was an interesting poll.
(We’re a day early, but, May the 4th be with you!)
This week, we’re giving away a brand new OnePlus 8 smartphone. Enter this week’s Sunday giveaway for your chance to win!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best gaming routers: Say goodbye to Wi-Fi lag</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So you’ve got a killer gaming laptop, top-of-the-line peripherals, and even a comfortable gaming chair. All you need to compete online now (apart from some skill, but you’re on your own there) is a killer gaming router. Not only will this virtually eliminate lag when playing on Wi-Fi, they offer other special benefits like gigabit ethernet ports and software solutions to manage bandwidth.
If you’re looking to take your wireless gaming to the next level, here are the best gaming routers on the market in 2020.
As far as gaming routers go, you won’t find a more fitting example than the Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX11000. Not only does its sci-fi spider look fit the gamer aesthetic, it’s one of the fastest and most powerful routers on the market.
With full support for 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), the Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 is a tri-band router, so you can dedicated one 5GHz band exclusively to gaming. Plus, unique software implementations allow further prioritization of gaming traffic and optimized connections to game servers to reduce ping and latency to a minimum. If that’s still not fast enough, there’s also a 2.5G ethernet port for blazing fast wired gaming. It isn’t cheap, but this is easily one of the best gaming routers you can buy.
If Asus’ premier gaming router is too expensive for you, the RT-AX88U is a great alternative. It still supports next-gen Wi-Fi 6 with speeds up to 6000Mbs, but does away with some of the more advanced software features of its more expensive cousin.
What makes this one of the best gaming routers you can buy is not just the incredible speeds, it’s also the eight gigabit LAN ports on the back of the router. All this connectivity means you can get the fastest possible speeds from both wired and wireless connections on all devices. For larger homes, it can be combined with the RT-AX92U mesh kit to boost coverage throughout the house.
When money is no object and you want the absolute best gaming router you can buy, look no further than the Netgear Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR700. Sure, it has six gigabit ethernet ports and one 10 gigabit SFP+ port for incredible wired speeds, but with Wi-Fi speeds up to 7.2Gbps you can safely leave cables behind.
Pure speed isn’t all this gaming router offers, with advanced Quality of Service features to make sure your ping is as low as possible. It also has a built-in Geo-Filter to make sure you’re always connected to the fastest server, plus a fully customizable dashboard to monitor bandwidth utilization by all devices on the network in real time.
It might not have all the bells and whistles of dedicated gaming routers, but the TP-Link Archer AX6000 gets the job done. Its eight high-gain antennas boosted by 1024QAM deliver speeds up to 5952Mbps via 5GHz and 2.4GHz connections.
Combined with eight gigabit LAN ports and one 2.5Gbps WAN port, you should have ample connectivity for all the devices in your home. Setup is also a breeze, and can be done via Bluetooth with the Tether app, which can also be used to monitor connections on the network.
While the above option is great for general use, TP-Link makes another more powerful model that’s truly one of the best gaming routers around. Although it looks like a demon summoning portal or alien mothership (take your pick), this tri-band router has all the features of other gaming routers at a much lower price.
With two 5GHz bands (one dedicated to gaming) and one 2.4GHz band, the Archer C5400X will ensure that you never miss a shot due to connection stutters or high latency. It also has eight gigabit LAN ports, more than enough for any wired connections your setup requires.
The last entry on our list of the best gaming routers is another relatively budget-friendly option. Zyxel might not be the biggest name in home networking, but its Armor Z2 AC2600 router is fantastic for the price. It delivers on speed with up to 2600Mbps of combined wireless, and even supports more premium features like MU-MIMO and dynamic QoS.
It has a respectable four gigabit LAN ports, and the only real drawback is a lack of customization features in the software. If you’re willing to install custom firmware like OpenWRT, you will find that this gaming router can compete with much more expensive devices from better-known brands.

Keeping your hands washed and germ-free has never been so important. As we continue to ride out the unexpected and increasingly worrisome coronavirus pandemic, federal and local governments are encouraging citizens to consistently wash their hands and avoid touching their faces—important sanitary measures that will undoubtedly help reduce the transmission rate of the virus.
But these standard sanitation methods can only go so far if you're constantly touching surfaces that may be contaminated. The Hygiene Hand: Antimicrobial Brass Door Opener & Stylus will help you take your hygiene routine to the next level, and it's currently available for 20% off at just $19.99.
This naturally antimicrobial brass stylus offers a completely germ-free way to open doors, press buttons, and use shared surfaces.
A favorite on Kickstarter, the Hygiene Hand is crafted from strong antimicrobial brass—making it naturally averse to a wide range of bacteria and pathogens that can make you sick.
The entire device is no larger than an average keychain so you'll be able to take it with you wherever you go, and an ergonomic finger hole supports easy use.
It's even easy to keep this trusty key as clean as it keeps your hands, since you'll be able to remove any remaining germs and pathogens with a simple antibacterial wipe.
Keep yourself and those around you safe and virus-free with a Hygiene Hand: Antimicrobial Brass Door Opener & Stylus. Usually priced at $25, this germ-killing utility is currently available for just $19.99—20% off its usual price for a limited time.
